Sounds great, right? Unfortunately the landlord is not the best. He seems nice but it will take FOREVER to get anything fixed, and he’s so cheap that the folks coming to make repairs sometimes make the problems worse. He drives up from FL about once a quarter to do repairs and upkeep on the building, but ends up doing a lot of it himself to save money — which means that things take too long on his trips to actually get repaired, so they require multiple trips. Also other apartments on this block are significantly cheaper. He turned one family, two bedroom apartments into four bedroom apartments with each bedroom on a separate lease. When I moved out, he was doing $1225-$1350 a room for these 4 bedroom units (he illegally turned the garage into a studio, and had a three bedroom unit in the basement and a one bedroom unit on the first floor as well). Two bedroom one family units in different buildings that were the exact same layout on the block were going for $2500. Same built in AC, more modern kitchens, same built-in washers and dryers. More room, for less money. Don’t move here.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,3.56,10.00,A,4%,1

The management team, that isn’t even searchable on the internet, is hardly responsive and the time I did have an actual issue I needed to talk to them about (washer leaking brown water everywhere and a few days later, water leaking from the kitchen ceiling) I was berated and belittled for asking for more information on the fix as I didn’t feel the repair was done correctly considering the multiple leaks in such a short amount of time. The super (Joan) is responsive but very rude and told me in so many words that I looked like a prostitute one day (I was in a skirt to my ankles and a turtleneck mind you…). The location that this apartment is in is not ideal. The corner of 97th and 2nd, which you have to pass every day to get to the Q has gotten quite bad. There are at least 3 homeless people that live on the corner now with a whole make shift structure and they use the wall of the building on 97th street for their restroom….. so I hold my breath and basically speed walk (watching my step of course) to and from work everyday. I do not feel safe on that walk to the 96th street Q train, and I was assaulted one time by a woman asking for 50 cents in front of the McDonald’s and when I didn’t give it to her she kicked me multiple times while I walked away.

It’s a 4 floor walk up in China town. In the summer every once in a while the hallways smell like Chinese food. 

The building shares a hallway with the cafe/ bar downstairs. The workers often smoke cigarettes so the hallways gets kinda gross. 

The apartment is new renovated and all the finishings are great! It’s a perfect size for two people. 3 if you share a bed. 

The bar in the basement of the building is a ton of fun and great people. Easy to grab a drink after work and just walk upstairs to go to bed. 

There is heat and air conditioning. Each room has its own air unit and that’s great because the kitchen gets very hot in the summer due to no windows. The bedrooms are often a bit colder because they have two windows each. 

I love this apartment and happy I have a two year lease on it. ",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,4.81,3.06,A,100%,1

Cons include frequent beeping on our block at all times of the day and night, difficulty getting in touch with building management, which at times gets a lot of information wrong pertaining to rent and lease. Slow response to getting things fixed in apartment. Intercom to let people into the building is often broken, and door handles for common areas are often messed up also. 

Otherwise, for the price of the size of the apartment, it’s amazing. Also, it’s a green building which definitely helps with the cost of electricity.

It has been fun living here but is definitely a lively building (big summer roof party vibes) - so if you want privacy, complete quiet, etc. this might not be the right spot for you. 

They do have private roof decks for some people living on the 6th floor, which is great. The building is pretty clean, has a package room and an elevator. 

In-unit washers are awesome. 

Would definitely suggest management clean up the party culture and close the roof to non-residents/non-deck owners during certain hours as things can get out of hand. ",X,X,X,,X,3,2,N,N,Y,2 bedroom,Currently live here,1-2 years,Westside,3.12,4.35,B,99%,1

In my opinion, the best thing about this apartment was its spacious, open layout and the updated bathroom and kitchen. I also didn't have extreme pest issues. The location is nice - right on park ave and close to Madison Square Park. There are lots of cute/fun bars on 3rd avenue too. It was very quiet as well - a bit too quiet for my personal taste ( I needed a bit more liveliness) but I know many people prefer the reprieve from the city noise. 

Negatives: 
My apartment on the 3rd floor got little to no sunlight - I suspect most don't given how the building is situated. Additionally, it is a walk up building with no garbage chute so, throwing out the trash felt like a bit of a hassle. There is also no laundry in the building so be sure to factor that expense into your rent. 

Additionally, I didn't see my super once or even have his contact information throughout the 3 years I lived there. In fact, the only time I saw him was right as I moved out. Even though there technically is a proper, he is difficult to get a hold of and does not have a copy of the keys. So, if you get locked out you're screwed. Also, good luck if you get locked IN (yes, in). The building is old and the wood of the door frame because particularly warped in the summer from the heat. I was horribly hungover one morning and had to be rescued from inside my apartment by the Seamless delivery driver because the door was completely jammed and I was just to hungover/frail to bust it open (Bless you, Jorge - wherever you are). Once again, without a super to contact this could be a tricky situation. 

Lastly, there was a persistent issue with hot water over the course of the 3 years I lived there. Hot showers became a luxury - particularly in the winter. ",,,X,X,,5,4,N,Y,N,1 bedroom,Less than 1 year ago,3-4 years,Back,4.64,4.03,A,99%,2

Plants loved this place. Train was really close to this place. During the day it was an amazing place, especially with all the shops around. The building management was pretty okay they seem to be respectful and Supper was really helpful and great overall. The one draw back of this place was noise, especially at night. It was so loud, there is a bar on the first floor which is really nice but at night after they close cars are parked all of the building just blasting music, to the point where it was hard to sleep some nights without ear plugs. The worst part was that they are all cars so it was near impossible to get them to be a bit quieter. beyond that I loved this apartment but the noise was unbearable at times even 6 floors up.

The units were recently renovated. The neighborhood is relatively quiet at night.

CONS
We occupied this apartment for a period of 12 months. The reason we decided to move out was due to very poor management. Both the property manager and his superior failed to offer any help with any of the issues we dealt with during our residency in the building. In more than one occasion, we asked for an opportunity to speak to them on the phone, and we never received a response. We left multiple voice messages, and they were all ignored, just like our emails were not acknowledged. 

MAIN ISSUES

Internet. Our internet cables and wall outlets did not work. Not one of them, not even once. We contacted the internet provider, and after their inspection, they informed us that this was a building issue – cables and outlets, and that it had nothing to do with the internet service. We notified the building managers, and their response was that the previous tenants did not have that issue, and asked that we have the internet company check again. We had the internet company come to inspect the cables and outlets not just a second time, but a third time, every time looked at by a different inspector, to the point that they told us that if they had to keep coming to the apartment, they would send an invoice for the service provided. We attempted to speak to management countless times, contacting them via email and phone, and we never heard back from them again. Not even an acknowledgment of our messages. In the end, we had to pay out of pocket to have someone bring a cable from outside through the window, which prevented us from closing our window completely. Needless to say, this was another challenge. In the summer the air conditioner escaped through that gap, and in the winter the cold air would come in through that gap. Once again, we asked for help from management, and we did not hear from them. Like we did before, out of our own pocket, we had to purchase parts to cover the gaps in the window.

Heating System. We endured a very cold winter because the heating system did not work. We notified management so many times, and they kept sending a building maintenance person to investigate, a person that did not have experience with the heating system. In the end, we had to report the issue to the city government. The city inspectors confirmed the heating system was not working properly. They came to the unit about 4 times, and each time a different inspector would note the same conclusion. In one occasion I ran into another resident, and I asked if he was having the same or similar issue, and it was then that I found out that there were 8 other residents who had organized communication with management, asking for the heating system to be fixed. Not surprising, they had not had any luck with management either. As it turns out, they were all just as frustrated and disappointed as we were.
OTHER ISSUES
While these issues might not as important to others, given the circumstances, it is worth adding to this review. In no particular order, 1) the walls were not properly painted when we moved in. Even the person that came back to paint said “wow” when he saw the bad job they had done the first time around, 2) the stove light fixtures burnt every other week, and we eventually just stopped placing tickets for it, 3) before signing the lease, they sold us the unit with heated bathroom floors, and as it turned out, the floors never heated, and when we told maintenance they told us that none of the heated floors in the building worked, 4) while the city might not require it for this building, it showed little care for the residents when they failed to install fire extinguishers in the building, 4) the trash section was always full of trash, to the point that one could often not get to the bins, 5) and last, but certainly not least, it required multiple follow-ups to obtain our complete deposit back.

We had stayed at our previous apartments for periods between 5 and 10 years. We were planning to stay at this apartment for an extended period of time, but their very poor management left us with no choice but to move out.

Management needs to be replaced immediately, if they want to keep residents for longer periods of time. This was a very bad experience, and we discourage anyone from even considering this building.",X,,X,X,,5,4,N,Y,Y,1 bedroom,Less than 1 year ago,1-2 years,Southside,3.48,4.85,A,100%,1

We had closet doors falling off and mounted clothing racks falling off too.

The landlord is very good at sweet talking, but is extremely stingy. He takes forever to repair or install anything shared between units (the dryer was out for a whole 2 months, and never followed up on the AC in the unit after 1.5 months). His expectations for restoring the unit to how it was when leaving are also unreasonable, exaggerating small nail holes and a paint chip in the wall ledge as major damage, and then taking a huge chunk out of the security deposit. Not surprised that the tenant who used to be in the basement spray painted and caused real damage instead. Not surprised there is also always tenant turnover in this multifamily building. It's also pet friendly, but the dog on the top floor is very yappy, so you'll hear it in the early mornings every day. There are also huge ant infestations when it gets warm.

The worst parts about this unit is the ventilation and plumbing. There is no window in the bathroom and it's difficult to get any air flow in. This unit is actually the other half of the second floor, purposefully renovated to create this extra unit for more tenant revenue, which is why parts of this unit don't make sense and contributes to the lack of ventilation. The plumbing is also weak, so you need to flush multiple times for the toilet, and the shower is not calibrated with the water temperature correctly, so expect to sear yourself a few times if you're here.

Other than all of the above, there is good food in the neighborhood, but there are definitely better rentals for the price you'd pay here. I would look elsewhere than deal with all these problems again.",,,,,,3,1,Y,N,,1 bedroom,Less than 1 year ago,1-2 years,,3.76,3.79,A,92%,1

It’s been not even two months since moving in and I wish I never would have signed the lease. The only perk to this apartment is the fact that it’s across from Central Park. The building (whole block actually) has a huge mouse problem, my apartment included, with a lovely mouse infestation in my kitchen. My bathroom ceiling has also been leaking for the past four days (not a small leak either), and despite submitting numerous maintenance requests with management, it still hasn’t been fixed. That’s 4 days of emptying out brown ceiling water from pots I have set up from the various leaks. So fun! For apartments that have these problems but have been ‘newly renovated’ it’s concerning to see, and goes to show how cheaply done renovations were. ",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,4.63,5.20,A,96%,3

1, Never there to help you when you need it. They will literally disappear and stop answering phones or responding to emails. But when they need something will hound you.

2. Poor heating and cooling situation in all apartments. Won't allow you to install Window AC units in many apartments because the only windows in the room are in the fire exits. They can easily provide a solution by changing the window types and installing ACs above the windows but are too cheap to do it.

3. The heating rods in the apartment are extremely loud and won't let you sleep. In the winter, good luck getting consistent hot water.

4. Packages? They get stolen, and if you report to the management they will ignore you. A few residents tried to get together and work with the police. But BLDG management took months to share the security camera footage with the police, making the whole thing inactionable.

5. Leasing process? EXTREMELY difficult to work with. Sitting in their leasing office speaking to the head of leasing I felt worse than I have at US Customs and Borders when coming into the country as a brown man in 2005, right after 9/11. Extremely hostile and condescending, and treating any questions I asked about some of the burdensome and archaic clauses in the lease documents as if I was somehow proposing the spanish inquisition.

They will scam you with their leasing ""special"" and then totally screw you on renewal.  Management does not care about you, and will not work with you.  I am with the other negative reviews.  They tell you they will ""take care of [you] upon lease renewal"" and that means they will ""negotiate"" by doing a back-and-forth dance and not listen to your needs.  The worst of the worst as far as any management company I've ever encountered.  Also, their ridiculous 421a surcharge is completely arbitrary--ranging from 2%-11%--and unnecessary.  It was intended as an incentive for new construction, but this building is 19 years old.  I told the ""Resident Retention Specialist"", Vanessa, that I would like to move to an apartment on the 7th floor at lease renewal because it was more affordable and I was told I could not do that because they would ""have to charge"" me 11% instead of the 2% I was currently paying.  The apartment has been sitting for MONTHS (and it still is!)   Fabulous way of retaining residents and ""taking care"" of them.  Scam, scam, scam.  Further, Mary, the Assistant VP, responds to you with boilerplate emails about how she ""apologizes"" for your frustration with the renewal process, but she doesn't hear, nor listen to what you have to say.  Just beyond awful.  I wrote a letter to the big guys in Chicago, and they passed me back to her, only to receive the same response.  

They also lie and tell you that occupancies are high.  Um, not true.  Look at the listings every day and see for yourself.  I also see and know people moving out every day because they've had the same experience.  Unbelievable.  At least they could work on some new lines for their BS.  I saw a few tours today when I was in the lobby, and it took all of my might to not say something to them about moving into this building.  You can find a more beautiful building with better amenities elsewhere.  I did. I'll be paying $1300 less than their offer, and two months free (they offered HALF of a month free when I really pushed them!) with a $2000 Visa gift card to offset their 421a surcharges.  Through this whole process, I learned to research occupancy rates and resident retention.  This building is low on retention because they just scam the next person and people are too lazy to negotiate.

Bottom line, they don't care about you at all.  They're trying to just stay afloat.",X,,,X,,3,4,N,N,Y,2 bedroom,Currently live here,3-4 years,Eastside,4.44,5.55,A,92%,1

First of all, since the pandemic they have hiked up rents. A 3200 apartment is now 3800. The apartment is NOT worth 3800. Let's talk about it:
***********************
1. The property management is Plaza Management. They are sort of nightmare management company you watch in TV shows. DO NOT TRUST a word they say. If you need repairs you will likely be on your own. 
A). You will be given constant attitude. The building manager is very nice. End of list.
They will ask you for christmas bonuses despite treating you like dirt. I ran into a neighbor on the elevator who was laughing hysterically at their email saying ""FOR WHAT?! A BONUS FOR WHAT?""
B) I told my broker about my experiences in the building and she commented that everyone is complaining that they find a way to charge you for everyyyything. And their fees are high!! 
C) You can do simple internet searches on Plaza Management. Every horror story imaginable. 
D) The rude and aggressive emails. Oh man. I got emails scolding me for things I didn’t do. When I politely clarified they had the wrong person, I got called a liar and got an even MEANER email to follow up. They speak to you like you're a child living in a dorm. Why is everyone here so mean? I’m paying you a lot of money!!!! 

2. When I toured the apartment I did a quick look around and it seemed fine. HUGE MISTAKE. The apartments look nice but they are SO SHABBILY made to the point that they are dangerous. Some issues while I was there
A). No hot water from the day I moved in. I had to beg them to come over and over to fix it. I was exiting the shower shivering because the water was cold. When the super finally showed up *days later*, he was SO ANNOYED. He scolded me but because I literally need the super's help, I had to just take it.
B). No heat. Thats right, in this fancy new building. I went into the hallway and 2 of my neighbors were also outside trying to figure out if others lost heat. When they came to ""fix it"" they just gave me a space heater but did not compensate me for the massive jump in energy bills. 
C). My neighbors heating situation was so bad that ice formed on his windows. Him and his gf had to live there for days until they figured it out. 
D). There are holes between the floor and the floor boards. It is SO SLOPPY and they will try to blame you for it when you move out. DOCUMENT the second you move in (if you made the mistake of signing this lease)
E). The cabinets and closet shelves are not secure. They literally fell on my guest when they hung up their coat. Management came and saw it, laughed** and said: ""yeah, the carpenter who made the apartments wasn't very good"". This is a law suit waiting to happen. 
F). The lobby doors broke and they just took a railing down to deal with it. How cheap is your building?
The hallways are falling apart and the building is not even old. Letters and numbers coming off. I counted 7 months that a light was out in the hallway and no one noticed. SUPER POORLY MAINTAINED. 
G) They used super cheap fake wood planks to make the flooring here. So you can use furniture cushions and still mark up the floor. Guess who will pay for the new flooring? YOU! Say bye bye to your security deposit. 
H) The sound systems don’t work LOL They look fancy in the walls but no one was able to get them to work. But that seems pretty expected for the building. 

3. The hotel attached may seem like a perk, but it is a HUGE NEGATIVE. 
A). The management company is also in charge of the hotel. So when you need them, they will be diverting their time and energy towards managing the hotel. The amount of times I reached out for something and no one is available for days and then I see them coming out of the hotel portion. 
B) The hotel is connected via elevators. Once I was on the elevator and a hotel guest got in. How is this not a massive safety issue? Hotel guests have access to the building randomly? So scary!
C) If you use the driveway in front of your apartment building - you will be screamed at. Not asked to move politely- screamed at in a humiliating and degrading way. 
D) Even the driveway that is made for the building was made poorly and incorrectly. Every time a car enters the driveway, there is a HUGE dip and if you have a low car, you WILL hit your front bumper. It is very clearly a construction error that they tried to patch up. 

4. The package room and virtual doorman is so unreliable. YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY FOR IT THOUGH!!
A). They advertise a ""virtual doorman"" but the reality is that it is so difficult to use that the delivery people do not use it. Your packages sit out in the lobby, where btw hotel guests can see.
B). The package room would sometimes be ""full"" so you will get a rude email from management or the super. I got scolded for not picking up packages that were delivered the same day and told its not storage. Again, for packages delivered THE SAME DAY. 
C). The reason the package room is full sometimes is because deliveries to the hotel will sometimes be stored there. Again, your resources will be used by the hotel and you will be inconvenienced. 
D) I got locked out so I called the virtual doorman. No one answered (not a joke). When I complained they said they didn't have enough staff. Isn't that the point of the virtual doorman???? I called 3 times. IT TOOK ME AN HOUR TO GET IN THE BUILDING. 

*********I have to reference a conversation I had with a neighbor where she said “I feel like I’m always getting yelled at or in trouble here.” ************They really treat you like you’re a child. The apartments are so grossly over priced I am SHOCKED to see the new prices. They are NOT worth this! Don’t get duped!! 

****THE POOL*****
If you’re moving here for the pool- just get a more accurately priced place close by and come use the pool. From what I hear, this summer it is not even included in rent anyways. The hotel staff are soooooooo nice and accommodating. You don’t need to suffer through living here for that perk! They say outside people can’t come in but that’s not true. As long as you’re purchasing food/drinks and not being disrespectful, etc.

I lived on one of the upper floors that was renovated a little, so I'm not going to whine about the ratty carpets (which the other floors have). My gripes are easy with the house. It is old, falling apart, and tenants and their desires are continually neglected by mgmt. As I came into the building at least once a week, there was some form of emergency/complaint relayed to the doorman (smoke coming from the stove, plumbing issues, leaks, electrical issues, crumbling plaster, offensive odors, noise levels and so on and so forth). Yeah, there are roaches and other creeping insects, but living in the city comes with that. The condition is, sadly, compounded by inadequate upkeep. There are various problems expressed by many people as regards office mgmt. The overwhelming one is the curt, nasty at times, Nature and unresponsive. The key worry of mgmt is to do very little and invest very little on (evident by little to non-existent building amenities and constant issues - such as elevators getting stuck). For two reasons, I left the house. Second, I was disgusted with the contract for renewal. My renewal lease was more costly than new tenants, as some reviewers claimed (for the same type of unit). In fact, the terms of the lease have changed dramatically, that you are locked into the apartment no matter what. Secondly, at equivalent or better cost, there are far better suits (updated, newer, more benefits). Brodksy doesn't care about a market where landlords (for the most part) are bent over backwards to hold tenants.

There are also some other short term rental companies that lease apartments and operate like a hotel. All to say that random people are coming in and out of the building constantly, and the doormen are a poor excuse for security. Someone broke into my apartment while I was home (terrifying) when I lived there, and when I called down to the front desk to report it, they blamed it on me (what?????). 

The apartment fixtures are nice - they are definitely quality apartments on the surface. But, keep in mind this is a converted office building and the walls are paper thin. The hallways reek and were usually dirty. The elevators were even worse - I can't tell you how many times I'd get in an elevator in the morning to find half-full beer bottles. 

I also was not a fan of UDR's approach to utilities. When I lived there (it may have changed, definitely check before you rent), some utilities like water were split among tenants - meaning you didn't pay for your own individual usage, but for the building's usage as a whole depending on the size of your apartment etc. Plus, UDR tacks on crazy random fees, both at lease signing ($500 for processing?) and monthly. 

Just save yourself the hassle and avoid 95 Wall (and 10 Hanover) if you can. You can find much, much better for cheaper in the area. ",X,X,X,,,2,2,Y,Y,N,Studio,Less than 1 year ago,Less than 1 year,Westside,3.79,3.06,A,100%,2

The apartment was renovated before moving in and the Supers have been helpful and friendly.  Sam has done a great job with garbage and building maintenance for this old 1922 building (especially taking care of snow removal). It would be great if the landlords would consider renovating the vestibule and lobby area to make it a bit more modern. I'm not sure if there is space in the basement, but it would be great to have laundry machines, or have hookups installed for stackable machines like apartments on the market today (as well as stainless steel appliances; they might in other apartments, not sure).

As for the area, Bensonhurst is very quiet (it's been a nice change from living in Midtown for 20+ years.  The D train (elevated) is ridiculously close.  The commute to Midtown takes about 47-60 minutes (can be tedious, but doable). As for food and shopping... there's pretty much everything you need -- a mix of chain establishments to older ""Mom & Pop"" stores.

It's a bad building-1, WATER OUTRAGES have been regular, sometimes many times a month: unexpectedly you won't find any hot water at night, no hot water in the morning, or sometimes all day, all of this occurs without warning. And it seems like the mgmt doesn't care at all, all the tenants were sick and tired of it, we submitted reports to the mgmt in the house, online, and they just couldn't address the problem, it kept happening over and over again. 2, Loud. Noisy. It's by 6th avenue and don't let you be misled by the new address-the it's same building and most of the units are facing the avenue. The taxis, the dump trucks, the sirens, the visitors, the crowds, everything you hate about New York City. Yeah, right as you felt things couldn't get any worse, the building began. Drilling begins at 7:30 am, and contractors operate in the building. 3, Bad Administration. Doorman is often frustrated and irritated all the time (except for one or two nice ones); mgmt management also does not respond to email. They never resolved the problem of the water outrage. 4, Problems with elevators. Since building begins, only ONE elevator has been left for all tenants. You'll actually waste more time looking for an elevator in the morning than waiting for trains. 5, renovated cheaply. They use the cheapest materials for the apts, here and there stuff sometimes crack. 6. Because of all the noise and dust, the porch is worthless. You're never going to love relaxing on the deck, because you're going to need to thoroughly scrub the seats nearly every day. The only thing that is nice about it is the location, but there are many options in the city, with a better experience, other buildings have similar offers. I'm never going to suggest that to someone.

From a long day at work, you come home so you can pay your almost $1,200 rent. You go to the lobby shop, which used to be for residents, but is now for the public at large.
 
 Within, a saggy-pants teenager with a skull cap eyes you up and down, and then leads you to the elevator, making lewd remarks.
 
 You're hoping for security cover, but security (the doorman) is busy watching television, sunken down so deep in a chair that he can't even see who's coming or leaving.
 
 For your own protection, instead of going to your apt, you wait for the weirdr to leave for fear of being pursued further.
 
 You are approached by the doorman who tells you that whether they are patronizing the store or using the lobby bathroom, non-residents have a right to be there. They are not, in truth, supervised and can wander easily past the toilets or shop. When the location of Broadway and 29th is the scene of a recent shooting and so much violence, you wonder if there can be such comfortable security that the police track it and intend to put crime cameras there.
 
 
 You talk to mgmt, but just to shut you up, you get pacifying answers. You know that the house you moved into years ago is now owned by people without a class who don't care and run an otherwise good Manhattan apt complex into an area like a public housing.

To begin, the landlord was nearly nonexistent and only available by phone. During the summer and early fall, we started getting mice in the kitchen and I would see large rats rumbling through the trash outside every night. Since this was an old building the wiring wasn't done properly and our electricity went out a few times if the dishwasher was on at the same time as another high power appliance. To make matters worse, we didn't have a breaker in the apartment and had to call the super to get power back. The bathroom was incredibly outdated which wouldn't be a problem, except nearly all the paint on the ceilings and sides of the walls were crusted and peeling due to poor ventilation. There was also mold in a corner of the living room. My room had an existing hole beneath the window where the old phone cable box was. If it was a particularly rainy day, water would enter through this box and another hole directly above it and flood my room. Another water issue was the broken steam heater. I had to keep a bucket under the valve because no amount of pressure adjustment would stop the heater from leaking. After the recent snowstorm in December 2020, the building was the only one of the block to lose power. The rooms of this apartment were fantastic spaces but what we gained in personal space we lost in cramped, uncomfortable, windowless common areas i.e. kitchen and living room. Some of the neighbors in the building had been living there for years and would talk about how neglected the building was. Yes, New York City rental market is a disaster but I would not allow any of my friends or loved ones to live in such a deteriorated apartment.

A pain to hang things on walls, but thickness keeps neighbors’ noise out. Be sure to check into any upcoming construction in the area. We didn’t, and construction on 86th street has been a (loud) nightmare, especially while being stuck home during  Covid...not their fault. Right next to Carl Schurz Park.

Its Very Outdated and not well kept and has not been so for about 10 or more years. The heating system is old and outdated and does not give adequate heat ( you will be freezing at times) as well as it often spouts out water in different areas. It is infested with Mold due to old leaks Upstairs, underneath the house and all over. There was Black mold found there in the bedroom while living here along with 3ft of Black Water under the floor of my bedroom. I breathed it in for months not knowing. Also There is lead in the Wall paint that in 2021 should not still be an issue that cant be rectified. The Pipes in the bathroom are horrible and the shower was not installed properly so prepare for clogging of shower and sink as well as getting locked in the shower due to the door not installed property. The Closets are filled with Mildew don't let the fresh coat of paint fool you. Mine along with other Tenants have had our shoes and closed ruined with mold spots don't put any of your belongings in there. There is no Vent over the stove so good luck if you cook getting all the grease that will cover your cabinets and every surface of the Kitchen. These outdated issues aren't the real issue because all of these things could be fixed if the Owner cared anything about People or The property she has the responsibility of caring for. The worst part of all this is that The Owner Lives Right above You ! and will lie about being the owner to avoid accountability. This house has been in this condition as long as she's had ownership and has hires a Property Management Company (Pomegranate Property Management ) to do her dirty work. They will over charge you in Rental Deposit and Realtor fee and you will have one person who will pretend to be friendly until you give up the $$ They claim to be online based even though they have a physical office and a phone number they can choose to ignore all your calls and refer you to using the online portal for all your communication and concerns. All while you Landlords Sits upstairs day and night living it up while your typing away in the portal about your flooding bathroom. She is also not liked in the neighborhood by most due to her rude and shady ways , The ppl in the area are however very sweet and friendly. The combination of a Slumlord and Greedy scamming Property Management Company is that you have neither of them on your side. The Owner has Cameras all over the house and sits on her couch and Bed watching everything. She will look at your mail if it ends up on her porch and at times wont even tell you it is there. The insulation is horrible and she walks so hard that you will think the ceiling will collapse you can hear everything happening up there from conversations, her Piano and live band , TV and the Creaky bed every time she gets in and out of it. She will also complain that she can hear everything downstairs and if your too loud she will complain. She is not very upfront and will appear to be nice, Trustworthy and honest but is the opposite. She will go behind your back and make arrangements and complaints without saying a word to you, will avoid saying hello so she doesn't have to face the people she is wronging. I lived here with a Child and not only was she rude to myself but also my 8yr old and during the middle of a pandemic and the world highlighting hate you just expect that An old Social Worker lady living above you would have some humanity considering ....In Closing Unless this place has been completely gutted out , changed management Or the owner becomes a decent human who takes pride in the property that she was blessed to have...

Place: nice place. Transportation: close to numerous metro lines, walking distance to Wall Street, Fulton Street and Cortland Street (easy access to 4/5, 2/3, n/r trains). A lot of taxis in front of the hotel. Diners: There are some nice options, but they're not good. Safety: this is really similar to ground zero, federal reserve and wall street, but you'd see that police and defense is not a matter of concern. Building provides a 24-hour doorman who knows residents and stops delivery guys from going straight in. If you ask me, as a tenant, if there's one thing I should retain and cancel anything else, I'd say keep my beloved doorman concierge team. They make me feel at home like that. Facilities: stunning rooftop, indoor pool, free 24-hour gym, children's playroom, laundry room, courtyard area, game room and valet service. 6 elevators on one wing and 3 on the other. Buildings are rent stabilized. Pets are the right Cons: 1. Lousy neighbours, guy. Tenants are primarily students who may compete with the enjoyment of the unit. For example, my neighbors smoked marijuana daily during the week, and the smelly reeks through the door, which I had to spray, mostly just to control our living standards. Even, those kids next door always had house parties-on the weekends! I don't want to be grumpy, but given that I had to work the next morning, it's pretty inconsiderate. I had to call the doormen downstairs to get them to calm down. Yet there are things that you can't manage, and you must be conscious of. 2. Before Sandy, the leasing office was not the friendliest, but there were a lot of concerns. Yet there was a shift in post-sandy attitude-people became more sensitive and tried harder to be supportive. But with that said, I've read and heard people lament, so the perspectives are different. 3. This building is situated in zone A- -This is, again, something you can't manage. No one will do it. There are poor renters who don't care about anyone else's living conditions who let their dogs poop everywhere or don't clean up. As a result, they defaced a nice building as such-whenever you walk or get off the taxi, you're greeted with this scent. Not to say that you can't bear it, but you should do something when you have visitors coming. 6. Thin walls, guy. 7. Rent pricer than other comparable buildings in the region (I stayed at 90 West, 10 Hanover, and 45 Wall) plus you're getting better facilities. But if saving money while enjoying the city is your motive, you might want to revisit this house. Hope this benefits both of us. Experiences vary, but mine was mostly positive except for some bad neighbours (rude children who share/divide 2 bedrooms between 3-4 people who show little respect for those living next door). If you wish to move to the house, please be kind to the doorman. -They are decent people and they really take care of your welfare.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,2.22,4.44,C,100%,19

Right before he made the Woolworth, the architect designed the house and it is clear to see the similarity. With high roofs, bamboo floors and stainless steel appliances, the units are well maintained, but the main draw is the spectacular view of the WTC site and Battery Park City. As is the sight of the modern glass towers rising among their largely art deco neighbors downtown, the two reflection pools on the WTC grounds below are unbelievably stunning. The Goldman building across the street also gives off a soft glow that belies its inhabitants' gut and pillaging impulses. In the other side, their styles of analyst/associate I have encountered in the building seem fine and natural so it is important to carefully cull the cultural thing at the top. The downside has been the continuing development, which can be a little disruptive from time to time, although interesting to watch. Though a fraction of what it was, any clanging or drilling starts once or twice a week in the morning. It's less than what you'd hear in Chelsea or Midtown, other than the general noise level. Traffic noise is practically zero, and with loud neighbours, I never had a concern. I'm a pretty light sleeper, but I sleep with earplugs on a daily basis and don't hear much at night. One more disadvantage: visitors. With the WTC Memorial now open, the place has become an attraction. All the hot to fat piglets from the Midwest and Europe will veer away from the building front until Greenwich is unlocked, but for now some of them congregate out front after leaving the memorial. This is one thing that could easily have been done differently by constructing mgmt-i.e. The visitor center downstairs has not decided, so it turns out they're in it to make a buck. For me, the good outweighs the bad, and the neighborhood has been easy from quick commutes to grocery shopping (Whole Foods up West St. offers $5 and lots of eating and 15-20 minute Smooth delivery options), so this is not for you whether you're searching for village-y elegance or chic. You can't do better with the cost if you're into slightly anonymous, comfortable urban living in a historic building and neighborhood.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,Currently Living,,,4.24,4.63,A,99%,17

* Super Spacious, really! It's a huge 1 Bedroom Apt with tons of storage space.
* Amazing location, right off Riverside Park. Peaceful and Quiet, very residential but still not too far away from all of the city's amenities
* Laundry next door, no need to go all the way to the laundromat
* HUGE windows for amazing sunsets and views overlooking the park and a bit of the Hudson River. Bonus: Super high cielings!
* Small-time, local landlords who care

Honestly, it's a great place only if you can live with these cons:
* A little dated fixtures, which add to the charm too at times, but creaky floors can be a bit annoying.
* Dated kitchen layout, there's a decent amount of space in the kitchen, but really the layout and current fixtures make it hard to work with.
* Being on Riverside Dr is nice, but lacks some of the convenience you get in other parts of the city. But that's just a tradeoff for the peace and quiet :)",X,,X,X,,5,5,N,N,Y,1 bedroom,Less than 1 year ago,3-4 years,Westside,4.87,4.33,A,96%,1

Don’t ask how I know that. The stovetop is small but everything works great, just would turn the hall closet into a pantry if you can for more reachable storage since the cabinets in the kitchen are a bit high for everyday access. And finally... this is five flights up. FIVE. Be athletic or be destined to a life questioning how it hasn’t gotten easier to climb the stairs in three years.

Pros: 

-24/7 Door Men: They’re friendly and helpful. I’ve asked my fair share of questions and they’ve always been thoughtful and kind when answering. They also seem to know some of the residents really well, often striking a quick convo here and there - which is a great sign. Whether it’s opening doors, getting packages, they’re always on top of it.

-Management: Management has been responsive and helpful to any emails. Haven’t had a response take over 24 hours. I had some issues upon moving in and inspection that they took care of the morning after sending them an email. 

-Location: The street the building is on is relatively quite and free of anything sketchy. The general area is great and right next to / close to a few restaurants and general stores  (Chick Fil A, Red Poke, Duane Reade, Target, Meet Market, Food Emporium). There isn’t anything you can’t get within a few minutes. It’s a safe area since you’re fairly close to Times Square and there’s always people, restaurants/activities and or cars around you. 

-Sound Isolation: I live on the 35th floor and sound isolation (from neighbors and street noise) has been excellent. The windows are thick and double pane. Other than the occasional sirens or loud motorcycles - which you can’t really avoid regardless, you’d be hard pressed to hear any street noise. I also have yet to hear anything from noise my neighbors. I was pleasantly surprised of how little outside noise I could hear with the windows closed and the lack of noise coming from any neighbors. 

-Rent Controlled: Self explanatory. 


Cons: 

-Upon move in, there where several appliances and or areas of the apartment that were not cleared thoroughly. There were a few dead flies in the fridge and a roach in the bathroom that I had to kill myself. That being said, management sent a cleaner in first thing in the morning to take care of anything that wasn’t cleaned to my satisfaction. It did irk me that I had to find out the lack of cleaning myself and am surprised this wasn’t done during a routine inspection. There were also a lot of outlets that were not working.  I will give them benefit of the doubt since my move in was 3 days after applying and they are understaffed due to covid. Apartments tend to have a few critters when they’re left empty for a while. Overall management was responsive and was able to remedy everything mentioned. 

-Amenities: This isn’t necessarily a con but more something thing to call out. This building was build in the early 2000s and the laundry room, appliances and amenities reflect that. The laundry room can definitely use a good cleaning. That being said, the appliances in my apartment are top of the line (despite being old) and the amenities are just fine. Nothing to write about. 

Overall I’ve had a really great experience in this apartment building in the few months I’ve been here. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the sloppy cleaning that was done (if at all) before my move in. Also the roach. That being said there are far more pros that outweigh the cons and my experience can definitely be a one off that might not happen / have happened to others. My only precaution would be to spend a few hours inspection the apartment for anything that might be broken and or dirty. ",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,3.11,5.75,B,98%,11

It’s in the nice neighborhood and everything (from groceries to cafes to gyms) is right around then corner! Least favorite part is that during winter time, the heater can go up really high and often couldn’t sleep at night because of how hot it was. The super lives in the building but really hard to get things fixed (only talking about precovid). Also, there’s a construction starting soon so noise might be some issues during the day if you’re working from home. ",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,4.72,4.81,A,99%,2

The upstairs bedroom with private bath has no door separating it’s stairway from the rest of the apartment which completely takes away privacy. The stairway that leads into the apartment however could easily be resized to give the apartment an extra 300ft of space would would’ve greatly improve the kitchen. Because of the quarters being so cramped the kitchen has no pantry and the overhead cupboard space is so high that anyone below 6ft needs a stepping stool to reach comfortably so we bought a stepping stool. One of the cupboards is so close to the wall it faces that it scratches the paint on the wall every time it’s opened. Counter space is non existent even with how small the sink is which is constantly clogged but not part of the landlords contract to be his problem. To add more space we purchased a mobile island which added storage as well as countertop space and had come in handy. The apartment needs more lighting because even with the 6 main lights and 8 smaller dimmer switches in the living room alone, having every light on reaches ambient level lighting at best. While the AC and Heating is a great touch it’s not powerful enough to probably heat/cool the living room/kitchen space without blazing/freezing the bedrooms which come up to temperature allot quicker. The rooms are small but I’d you keep your bed size at a full or invents in getting a loft bed and keeping a couch and or futon underneath you can maximize space. Only in the back bedrooms though bud this applicable as the bedrooms with the street view have lower ceilings stopping at 9ft tall. The sink in the downstairs bathroom is aesthetically pleasing but practically a nightmare because the basin fills too quickly and doesn’t have enough lip space to not overfill. The bathtub was a nice tough but the automatic drain stopper mechanism does not work and again not liable in contract for the landlord to fix. Use bed risers to make the beds high and give yourself more storage space in the rooms and if you keep a 4 door dresser and a bed in the back two rooms you could fit a small desk in the corner as well. The dishwasher while a great addition isn’t super effective sadly you’ll still have to prewash all dishes before using it and even then you’re still need to keep it on heavy wash. The main saving grace of this place is the fact that water is free so overall I’d give it a 4/5 because while moderately inefficient it doesn’t take much to make it work and considering every room can be filled at the price of 650$ a month it’s still a great deal for Bushwick.

If I'm going up or down, I always have to wait 15 to 20 minutes to get into a crowded elevator. It's an awful way to start your morning, or to finish off your long day. Although the doorman and leadership are extremely fine, mgmt was nothing but reckless and pointless. For the elevator ""modernization"" tragedy, not one person from the mgmt office has taken any blame. ""we are not making any further concessions""we are not making any more concessions""we apologize for the inconvenience.""we apologize for the inconvenience. I feel like I am being cheated each time I write a rent check. The washing machines (which also underwent a ""modernization/upgrade"") break more than I think they can, as well as the system to replenish your pre-paid laundry cards, in addition to not operating elevators reliably and properly. Also, I think there are always rats scurrying around outside where the Rite Aid is because of the 2nd Avenue subway building. I assume that even with an apartment that has not been upgraded in decades and elevators that are continually disabled, I'm over paid in rent. If and when the elevators operate well, I can only guess how much rent they would charge. I sincerely feel that in Manhattan, you will find a better offer. It's not worth this spot!!! There are ones farther east (on York and 1st Ave) that have completely working elevators and affordable rentals for Manhattan if you are looking for a full service building. Fortunately, I'm moving this one out and counting down the days. If you are thinking about coming to Normandy, I suggest that you come in the morning and evening during peak hours to get a realistic feeling about what living here is like. Yeah, also in respect to the pool and spa, you have to pay subscription dues (currently $65 a month) up front for the whole year.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,3-4 years,,4.14,4.70,A,99%,16

I lived there for two years and would still be there if I hadn't found a job on the west coast. Apt: 2 beds, 2 bathrooms, marble cabinets, SS GE appliances, well updated door hardware, bathroom fixtures, shower heads, etc., pretty hardwood floors. We had absolutely no complaints about the physical quality of the device, particularly the cost. Popular areas: nice roof deck with deck chairs and tables, midtown views, bridges, Brooklyn, FiDi, and WTC. Another balcony on the 15th floor facing street-not much of a view other than the street and foley square (and the federal building!) but a clean, outdoor room to hang out for those of us without private balconies. The laundry facility is clean and certainly has ample laundry equipment, while $3 is steep. I never used a gym in the house, so no opinion, I'm sorry. Management: No questions about Anthony at all. He is capable, supportive, and nonsensical. He appeared to be nice with the girls, too. Every single member of the maintenance and doorman management team was respectful, charming, supportive and unfailingly welcoming. They have made a big difference in our quality of living, and I still admire it. Place: The 4/5/6 stop in foley square was a 2-minute walk and great for me. It's 1 express (4/5) stop from the union square, but if you need 1/2/3 or A/C/E, this isn't the best spot for you, but you already know that. There's not a lot of nightlife or diners in the vicinity—mostly government offices. Really, this suited me because it was peaceful at night, and I'd rather go out in the village or LES anyway. The Duane Reade and Starbucks downstairs is enough to make this a comfortable block to live on. Bottom line: We've had a really good experience.

This happened 3 days ago, and the mgmt building didn't do anything. They didn't even send an email to renters asking them not to let strangers in at the front door. At the end of the day, as long as they get our money, I don't think they care much for the people who live here. I signed a lease of 18 months and wished I hadn't even signed a lease of 1 year.

The good: apts are a decent size. And there are doormen to accept packages. Elevators. 
The bad: this is an old building. Not beautifully old, just old. Meaning: the a/c unit, also the heater, is controlled downstairs. The switch between cool air and hot happens irrespective of what the weather is outside, so you can be sitting in a full-service doorman building, in a large apt., wishing to god you were in a walk-up apt w radiators that go on when it's 45 degrees outside, instead of a/c. Now, the a/c: not all units actually cool. Getting the maintenance guys to come service it and FIX it does not seem to be possible. It would be so much better to install a window air conditioner.

I have a friend who is one of this building's founders who actually has an apartment here, and I have another friend who lived in this building for two years and moved out 5 months ago. They have sins on the house and in front to stop in to see the leasing office availability. I passed through the lobby and was halted at the front desk by the ""concierge"" He asked me to wait because he was struggling with food disorder, and he asked me for my name, and where I was going. I told him that I wanted to see one of the bedrooms and that I had a friend who used to stay there, and I met one of the owners who lived in the house. He asked him who my friends were, and I told him the names of my friends and the apt numbers. About a year ago, he told me my friend had moved out. I said no. Five months ago, my friend moved out, so what did it matter? I have a friend of mine who's living here and I want to see apts. ""He looked at me and said to himself, ""- Really?! I asked his name and he looked down and just said, "" Really?! I asked for his name and he looked down and just said "" And he pointed to the entrance. I went out very upset and began searching down the block at another house. I then called the leasing office and talked to AJ, who was very nice. I told her I was looking for a single bed, a bath, and looking to pay less than $ 4,500. She told me she had one for $ 3,750 open. I told her about what had happened 30 minutes earlier and after arranging the showing.The front desk rushed back to where I was talking to the porter before I knew it, and pulled me to the front desk, threatening to call the police. I asked him for his name when he called the police and he declined to give it to me. (He was a really tall Russian man, maybe 6'5 with short hair) I then called AJ in leasing who came down to fix the problem. By telling AJ that I pretended to have keys and remained in the house, he then tried to weasel out of it, but he didn't know me so he needed me to leave. I asked the concierge again what his name was, because I know one of the building's owners on a personal level as well. He looked down and stepped down into the package room behind the front desk when he noticed it, before AJ showed me a floor map for the listing we were concerned about and told me that she would make the director reach out to me and that they would take care of the problem that happened, and then I left. I saw her arguing with the concierge as I left. It is a tragedy how prospective tenants and friends of existing tenants/owners like to be handled. After what I saw and how I was handled, I strongly doubt that I would move into this house, or if I were to move in, I would make it a living hell for the concierges. I will probably have a lot to say to the director and even to my friend who is a part owner of the building to make sure that the member of the front desk management is appropriately dealt with.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,,,4.42,3.06,A,100%,21

And it's hard to shake the impression that the mgmt is only trying to milk you for as much money as they can. As the Corona virus has contributed to unprecedented improvements, one would expect the mgmt to have a somewhat clearer grasp of the significant others who remain (even though, under usual conditions, they live at a separate permanent address and abide by the guidelines and only attend weekends) However, that is not the case. The packing office failed to inform us when the parcels mailed to my address under the name of my significant other were shipped, did not record them, and made it quite a stir to find and send the package to her when she came looking for clarification. Now they've told me that they're sending back parcels under her name. (Note that there were only 2 such shipments in 4 weeks, and again this is attributed only to the present circumstances). Of course, the requisite shipments can be forwarded to my name. But it's a callous, money-grabbing tactic that's disrespectful on the part of the mgmt. (They require residents to pay $100 per person for access to gyms and facilities, however holding mail hostage and sending it back is serious. However, the amenities like the rooftop bar, spa, and meeting rooms are gorgeous. However, something that was not necessarily made clear during our tour was that all the lounges close at midnight were unpleasant. So the thought of finding a place to work in e. So if you're someone who runs late, you'll have very little time to enjoy it. Similarly, by switching to the tidying service, it seemed like it might be helpful (quick tidy once a week, actual tidying once a month). However, the weekly tidying is very simplistic and does not take any requests into account (for example, we don't care if you don't make a bed or unload a dishwasher, but you may like to wipe the bathroom mirror with Windex instead). The real monthly tidying spotty and shallow as well, for example, once again ignoring wiping down the mirror or tidying the bathroom.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,Currently Living,,,4.84,4.44,A,100%,10

In the evenings it is much quieter. On the weekends one can sit outside and enjoy the natural surroundings. The flora and fauna. The birds and bees. The squirrels scurrying about. The occasional raccoon family or opossums. The pavements increase the walking score for pedestrians and bicyclists. Great starter homes for young couples, families with young children, and empty nesters. Near to Ridgehill Shopping Center and Stew Leonard's. Reliable public transportation. Award winning schools and turn-around schools. Multi-ethnic and multi-linguistic. You can meet people from all over the world. Although the housing and rental costs are above the mean average, Yonkers is still an affordable option for anyone wanting to relocate to Westchester. Yonkers borders NYC and several bedroom communities. The BMX4C can whiz you to work in the Bronx, or Manhattan. You can travel by subway from the Bronx, or take the Metro North Railroad from Yonkers-on-Hudson. What a scenic view. Although I have relocated out-of-state I still visit Yonkers from time to time, and I am proud of how this large NYS city has evolved into an epicenter of socio-economic-cultural activities through community engagement, diversity, and inclusion. Yonkers is more than a City-on-the-Hill. It's more than the setting for ""Hello Dolly"" and other notable movies. Yonkers or the Big Y-O is the birthplace of many famous people. Van Cortlandt Park on the border of Yonkers and the Bronx offers cricket, baseball, basketball, and equestrian activities. You can ride your bike or unique. Only 25 miles from Columbus Circle, NYC. Come home to Yonkers, a 21st century city for people of all ages. Come and visit. Stay for the rest of your life! I'm proud to call Yonkers home! Yes, I'm proud to call Yonkers home!""

Until I moved in, I wish someone had warned me, hoping I could spare future landlords any of the trouble I went through. There are few pros, to be honest, which are: - position (it is strategically situated across Brookefield and surrounding subways 1, W, R, 4, 5) - good lounge and a small but adequate gym - most management is good and polite - good exterior and high roofs Cons: - Something is missing and nothing is repaired. From November to December, the heating/air machine was disabled and nobody was in any hurry to repair it. I sat for a month on a space heater. It was finally patched, but it took a month! My top lock was broken when I moved in and now remains unfixed because ""I don't really need a top lock"" due to maintenance. My dishwasher kept leaking and they said I was using so much detergent, but it turns out, inside the dishwasher, there was a missing component that they replaced after my second submission. In the shower, the fluorescent light went out and they told me that I would have to spend $30 to switch the light, but it turned out the electrical wiring was disabled in the bathroom. The engine in my fridge has already burnt out 3x and they replace it with another used engine each time. After a 4th work order from the fridge about the burning stink, the solution? They reduced the temperatures in the fridge and freezer and begged me not to change the temperatures. All right, now I'm going to use my freezer as my refrigerator. -The management doesn't even let you know if the job order has been settled in your home or if they've really fixed the issue. I have had to find out about their visit through my Dropcam on numerous occasions.It's all right that you're inside my home to repair a problem without notification or note, but you would welcome any respect or notice or change. From the outside, the building can look fine, but the system is defective and the building is not well maintained. In a regular basis, the elevators freeze and get trapped. Laundry rooms and rooms for compactors are still dusty. On the side of the house, the pile-up of trash is a daily thing which slices through the pavement. - In the valet room, which is open until 7p on weekdays, smaller packages are stored. Bigger parcels are left in the corridor for delivery, which is not the safest storage area and may be left open for days during the days when you are away from home. - There is a sulfide problem in the house, which is what causes the ""rotten egg"" odor. I have always stinked it in and around the house, but I had to report it to 311 when it started to stink like rotten eggs inside my apt, Whether it was, in truth, a gas leak. But, fortunately, it wasn't — it was just the sulfide in the sediment that had been stirred up by the storm and fallen into my flat. Overall, from the outside, the house looks fine and is in a comfortable location. However, inside the house, it is a completely different matter. Construction structures and machinery are poorly planned and managed. A band-aid is introduced to the management's approach to addressing job orders, leading to a constant loop of recurring problems. And they'll nickel and dime you every chance they get and don't have money to support you with your troubles, as nice and polite as they are. It just makes sense for them to contend with a lawsuit ( ).",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,4.24,4.63,A,99%,17

Since the mid-80s, I have worked in many NYC residential buildings as a doorman, concierge, elevator operator, porter, etc. It happened to me that working summer holiday relief guy in a decent residential bldg will be a good way to replace the income I'm about to miss (I'm a sub-teacher). I applied to some property managers online, and last week I received a call from Mr. Baretto of TF Cornerstone. Mr. Barretto was intrigued with my resume, which seemed to deliver just what he was looking for: a presentable, well-talked, well-experienced guy who would be able to navigate a super-challenging lobby. Many of the Upper East Side co-op units would have between 25 and 100 units. I operated in a co-op in 2003 with 25 duplex units and a penthouse. 535 Park Ave. has two men in the lobby-one at the entrance, the other in the elevator-for 16 hours a day, taking charge of the 25 apartments. 2 Gold Street still hires 2 men in the lobby for 16 hours a day—to accommodate 839 units! Last week Mr. Barretto arranged an appointment for me to see the resident bldg mgr, a professional looking fellow named Mr. Butta. Luckily for me, Mr. Butta was arrested and did not wake up until 11:10 a.m. This gave me an opportunity to ask a few questions to Daniel the concierge. The first thing I asked was why he worked alone in this Immense 51 story complex. This brilliant and polite young man told me that Cornerstone had recently gotten rid of one of the lobby workers, so every morning between 4 a.m. and 12 noon ONE MAN takes charge of all 839 units plus other well-traveled public areas, e.g. roof and party rooms. I asked how long he had been there. ""Less than 2 years."" I've never seen a guy of less than 2 years of experience working the prestigious 8am-4pm shift in my many decades of service. That job has always been handled by the senior manager. ""Wow, that's amazing you got this shift so quickly!"" I said. ""I started in the package room, and recently started doing this job,"" he said, smiling weakly. Then, I had a chance to speak briefly with a bldg porter in the lobby. He told me that the management had just recently been allowed to join the Bldg Service Union of NYC, Local 32BJ. That and the ludicrous workload explained the fast turnover of the lobby management. Under the Union deal, individuals like Daniel with fewer than 2 years of work are entitled to just 75% of the minimum wage. Daniel would have to live for a full 42 months before he is entitled to the minimum salary of $25 per hour required by the Union contract. Lots of luck, brother of the union. At last, Mr. Butta came and looked up and down at me, obviously thinking how great a gem I got to be applying for a nightmare job like this at my age. We briefly addressed my previous experience, and then he posed some of the peculiar problems of working on this over-cost shrine to cynical, selfish NYC landlords. To his credit, he genuinely acknowledged that the Bldg was inhabited by a lot of young people with drugs and alcohol problems and little regard for their neighbors. He asked me if I think I could cope with that kind of grief by shipping 500-1000 parcels every night, checking guests, handing out keys and papers, announcing 100-200 food deliveries, and several other activities. ""I think so,"" I said wrongly, wondering if they'd like me to stick a broom up my—-so I could vacuum the @#$ percent of the floor when I was doing something else. Then Mr. Butta called a concierge over Daniel, whose multiple tasks evidently involved questioning strangers like me. We were joking about how intense things got most of the nights in the lobby. I tried my best to pretend that I was involved. Fortunately, the interviews stopped, and I left 2 Gold Street shaking my head in amazement. I grinned recalling that it was a cutthroat, a prison, handling agents like this that caused me to go to college 20 years ago, not that it appeared to matter too much. Anticipating that this would be a bad bldg position if I took it, I sent Mr. Barretto an email early that morning, hours before I approached Mr. Butta. I told Mr. Barretto that, because I am what the Union contract called a ""experienced man,"" and that this was an open role and not a summer relief job, I will be allowed to start work at 100% of the minimum wage. I've never heard of Mr. Barretto or Mr. Butta again. You're being alerted.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,,,2.22,4.44,C,100%,19

1. Great landlord; an older Chinese lady that is very sweet. Her son (Bill) is the one that talks to most of the tenants; also a nice guy.
2. You can negotiate the rent; I signed my lease pre-COVID for $3,600/mo, but they're allowing me to renew for cheaper (~$2,900/mo with flexible terms).
3. Location is great: just east of SoHo, west of Chinatown, and North of TriBeCa.
4. Spacious living room and kitchen. The entire apartment is ~800sqft if I'm not mistaken, which is very nice for NYC, especially downtown.
5. The bedrooms get plenty of natural sunlight, which is awesome.
6. Citi Bikes are right around the corner which I loved. Subways closeby too.

CONs:
1. Had a small problem with bugs (ants); nothing crazy, but they were there from time to time.
2. The apartment is a bit older in general. They advertise it as having just been gut renovated, but I don't believe that.
3. The bedrooms face Centre St, which is a pretty busy road (it can get noisy). Early in the mornings, there is typically a small shipping crew for the business (Taiwanese produce shop) that occupies the bottom of the building... they're not great about being quiet.
4. There are no built-in closets.
5. The living room can get dark in the afternoons as there is only one window in the kitchen/living room that faces east towards another building.
6. You have to pay rent by check. I thought this was particularly annoying because it just adds one more thing to your to-do list to stay on top of.",,,X,,X,4,3,Y,N,N,2 bedroom,Currently live here,1-2 years,Front,4.81,3.06,A,100%,1

They would leave residue after every wash which was frustrating, on top of charging almost $7 a load... Don’t live here unless they offer you a super cheap rate and it’s worth it to you.

Don't be misled by the fair rent/square footage available here. Especially if you're a young professional. This building is terrible and the worst 'luxury' building I've ever seen in my 10+ years in Manhattan. 1. Doormen are NOT friendly in the very least, but they whine publicly about their work, because it makes sense that they will be resistant to helping you (i.e. standing there and looking at you trying to open the door with three suitcases, a puppy, a bag and a purse in your hands) 2. The state of the house is completely shameful-construction since 2018, wallpaper is falling down, carpet stains everywhere, nobody vacuums almost enough, the walls are riddled with marks! 3. Good luck messaging mgmt for anything-Maeve the PM doesn't respond to an email and doesn't phone. If you're lucky enough to grab her, she'll read a script to address you, which we all know doesn't lead to any solution. 4. There's ALL scaffolding over the building with no end in sight. I've got scaffolding soon after moving in and they refuse to give me a timetable as to when it's going to be demolished because they're not allowed to 'under the building rider in my contract.' I'm paying a higher rent for a private terrace room that's made worthless. 5. Edwin is a decent doorman, but Cesar is the worst doorman in the world-his temperament is bad and he behaves as though we were responding to him. He's going to get police residents shouting orders about dogs, mail, etc. 6. Gani, the super, is just as horrible-never he's going to address a Real problem as he's going to have to get 'outside approval/authorization' for stuff like upgrading the a/c unit-but he's literally never. So problems like a broken a/c device go on for months and months and months, while the mgmt office property insists they've never heard about such a thing, and it's getting so bad that the mgmt office's response is to move you to one of their smaller apt houses. 4.

They don't turn on the heat until you have a certain temperature outside, so you're left to freeze in the NOVEMBER 9 apt. Their elevators are constantly disabled or jammed, in addition to getting a 'service' elevator in the bank for the resident elevators so you're forced to stare at the garbage can run up and down the building all day long-very unsightly and not a nice look for the visitors! 10. 10. There are so many college kids in this house. That paired with the lack of tidying done, don't be surprised if you wake up to a couple of beer cans on your floor or in the elevator. 11.-11. Back to the children of education. They even talked about the persistent scent of Cannabis on the floor again, really annoying as a young construction professional-not the lifestyle I'm looking to deal in! Twelve. The amenities don't exist, let me reiterate that they don't exist! No valet/mailroom/dry cleaning/concierge! Doorman stack boxes in the lobby and cope with the activity in place that I'm sure adds to their still very dissatisfied mood. Their rooftop is a very Little black tar mess with a few unusual chairs and sunbeds up there. It's not worth it. The 'lounge' doesn't exist anymore. There's no gym. 13. 13. The entrance to the building is not on John St, but on 15 Platt St-and is actually a service entrance to the building as the main entrance has been closed for 1+ year now. This door is filled with litter piling up outside, rodents, and broken windows. It's also extremely unsightly for visitors to see and find someone from a delivery point of view. It opens out into the courtyard of the Sheraton Hotel, which is bad as well. How is this luxury!? 14. 14. If you have any problems, you won't find it easy to contact mgmt. Maeve, the Property Manager, does not respond to emails, take calls or return some sort of contact until you have made clear attempts for many months. I believe I've discussed this before, but this is by far the most infuriating situation in this house. 15. 15. Last but not least, this is a Filthy house! I said it before, but I want to stress this again. If you're going to visit the leasing, inquire to climb a few floors!! Look at the walls, the filthy carpets, the streaks, wonder where the garbage is stored in the house and where it's put out (by the entrance) for rats to feast on!",,,,,,0,0,,,,,Currently Living,,,4.22,4.44,A,100%,16

I have read some of the other comments and have to admit that for this house, I don't really have anything derogatory to say. Yeah, there is sometimes no hot water in the morning (probably 5 times in 3 years) and the rent hikes last year have been insane (although with negotiating they have kept our rent flat for all three years we have stayed here). A goodr may be the roof deck, but at least there's one! Other than that, it was incredible! Here goes: I refuse to call them management, even ""management"" Friends are the people here. Larry is such a delight in the morning, and Mike, Donny, Melvin, and Ozzy are all so sweet! They also make me feel very comfortable, so I feel like they're watching me out. Approximately a year and a half ago, my sister came and visited and people always ask me how she is. Each occupant is remembered because they are lovely people. We live on the 45th floor and have beautiful natural light and panoramas. We just love our apartment. We've got a walk (so rare!) in the wardrobe and plenty of room. The toilet is so cool and has plenty of counter space. My favourite part is the kitchen. I love the fridge's ice/water and the hot water spicket next to the sink. I just enjoy the filtration of all the water. There's a nice gas stove. The machine has washing, which is Awesome! And they're not those small washer/dryers ideal size either. They are big and nice. All of the appliances, in fact, are very tall. Gym/common areas The wellness center is very good. I have a crunch membership nearby, but I have actually begun to use the gym in the building a lot more. I've got a trainer here who comes to work with me and all the equipment is fine. I was in the pool 2 times in total. Hate that there isn't an open area that receives some sun by the lake. Impoverished preparation there. The roof is fine, but I'd like it to be bigger and hold the chairs out all year round. 2 There is a lot of goodr roof in gold across the street, but you have to live with the feeling of a frat house over there and the apts suck (we lived there for 2 years before moving to Liberty) People There are not many apts per floor, so it feels really private. This is a crowd that is far more family/business. Not being rowdy. I can never hear from my neighbors. We had a bit of a problem with smoking on the floor. Somebody smoked on our floor sometimes in their apt, and we might stink it at our apt. I called Ester and it was locked up by them. Theme solved. The financial district is an area, but it is not the West Village. That's a trade off. I love it personally. It is so dark at night down here. Recently, they put in quite a few diners, including a nice new taco spot across the street, clay over, chipolte, financier down stairs, dunkin donuts, and my favorite personal pump. We enjoy getting brunch on the weekends at the seaport. Only a very cold vibe. I am really sad that I am leaving this place. It feels like home, really. Whoever moves into this room is very blessed!

The management (doorman) is usually fabulous (in particular Marcos, Matt, and Jean-Michel) but the leasing management is awful—rough, unhelpful. Construction is endless—expect not to be able to use your apt during the day as construction noise is intolerable, and water (especially hot but sometimes cold) is regularly cut off. Windows are paper-thin (which makes heating in winter and cooling in summer expensive) and the AC systems haven't been upgraded since the 1970s, so they're very noisy. For a 1-bedroom (two AC units) but for a $300-400 monthly bill just to keep your apt below 80 F in the summer (speaking from experience). Building was designed in the 1970s to serve low-cost housing, and although the lobby and public areas today look fantastic, the real ""backbone"" of the building has not improved. Plus, prepare to hear all that's going on around you: hallways, neighbors' apts, construction—you'll hear it all. Don't expect anonymity. I lived in a number of buildings in Tribeca Area, Midtown East, Brooklyn Heights, Soho—both old and modern.

Sadly, my apartment has rats. They have definitely been improving the house, of course (working on the exterior plus painting the hallways and replacing the carpeting in the hallways). For around 6 months now, this has been going on. I had no idea that this was going to go on when I signed my contract, so I thought it was dishonest. I'm sure it would look pretty cool when it is done. But don't fool yourself, this house is only a pre-war one. I noticed what I'm pretty certain sounds like a mouse hopping about above the roof right when I first moved in (prior to the work being done) (in the walls between floors is my guess). This is clearly not appropriate for the rentals they charge (in my case, over $2400). I still had the building come in to try and cover up the gaps in the walls (and they were very sensitive to the building's credit, doing so the next morning). Just a couple of weeks later, I got a new cursor. What I'm looking to do now is get on from this house. Again, it's a shame, because I still have a lot of good things to say about the town, other than that. But I'm just not someone who can deal with mice (and probably not at that rent!) I can also mention that they have a gym (which I felt was a real benefit) and TVs for completeness. Bike storage is available (which I didn't use). In the house, laundry (very convenient and I thought was very reasonably costs). There is a (not too large) roof deck that I've never used. I assume they were doing construction on it anyway. The building's lobby is really cool and the staff working there are top notch (from doorman to handy-men). The lifts were decent and were quick. The fixtures in the apartment were also first class.

My unit is located in the bottom floor of a walk up, which makes it east for groceries and day to day functions, but comes with the cons of hearing traffic right outside our door in the “lobby”, as well as street noise, which in East Harlem can be pretty loud at times. Because of our location, it is pretty affordable to live here, especially with roommates ( I have 3) and I enjoy the high ceilings in our particular unit. We have fairly recent updates to our kitchen appliances, and there are two washer/dryer machines in the basement of the building, a huge plus. However, storage is very minimal, with only one closet in two of three bedrooms, meaning our third roommate’s “closet” takes up space in our main living area, and one bathroom which as you can imagine is a challenge amongst 4 people. As my first space in NYC, this was a great starter apt, and has helped me navigate what I desire in a living space when I look for a new apartment. You’ve got a great coffee shop around the corner (Harlem Blues Cafe) and a few grocery stores close to the area, a friendly live-in superintendent, and in case of emergencies, right down the street is Harlem Hospital.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,4.31,6.10,A,97%,2

When you have bad things to say, it is always easy to write and few people care to write a positive review, I suppose. First of all, the walls are very thick and useful for sound proofing. The neighbours can not hear you. However, the front door is not well sound-proofed, but the only noise you hear from the neighbors is as they walk through the fine, big, carpeted corridors. Management is really nice, but there are a lot of them and they waste a lot of time hanging out at the service entrance, with one or two exceptions. However, I don't get angry if I have to open a door for myself (the doorman does other things sometimes) and I've never begged a doorman to get me a taxi. I've got 2 guns and I can do it on my own. Outstanding shipment managing from the administrators. The boss is better described as inflexible, but I guess you kind of have to be with too many apts. Ever respectful and quick to respond, If not, fix those concerns. I comply with the tipping holiday. 33 administration and no tub for tipping. It's difficult to know anyone by name, but tipping has been a bit of a nightmare! The house is very neat, beautiful, underused public rooms. For gym membership and shared spaces, you pay $350. That there are now non-residents coming in to use the gym during the day is a little bit annoying. Apparently mates or something offer them the key fob thingy. Very fast and competent repairs in the apartment. With the hot water source, they do have daily problems. It appears to break down every couple of months, which is not pleasant when you consider the leasing costs. There are very high energy costs, more than half of the overall cost of distribution. Heating and hot water are free of charge, air con is fine (but you do pay for the electricity for the fan to distribute the heat). The apts are so well heated, but we didn't have that much ventilation on them. It is a pain not to be able to open the windows wider than 2 inches. From 37th street, there's a lot of noise and that and the neighborhood is the biggest reason we're definitely going to leave soon. They're all very stupid drivers on the way to the tunnel, honking the horn, which is a hassle. And all these big trucks that drive to Jersey make a lot of noise. At one end of the block is a needle exchange service and at the other is a half-way home! Yet I have never faced any difficulties. Yeah, there are a lot of people standing around looking sketchy, but nothing has happened (although I do think that it seems to be getting worse). Concrete, the opposite bar, can be pretty loud in the evening. It is accurate that you have to take your dog in and out of the building and just use the service door. But I would prefer the apts overall. Nice kichen appliances, high-quality finish, good wardrobe room (but the bamboo flooring looks pretty fluffy and not hard-wearing and now dreading getting our deposit back). The only downside is that the rentals are a little high (although next year's rise is only $100 per month, which is very fair from what I have heard).

We have a child and need more space, so we're thinking about moving. The truth is, everything else is a step down until you get used to this fabulous building and it is leadership. The only real concern I have is that the house is not to blame at all. The tone. I am a light sleeper and in the nights, the street noise can be pretty horrible. It looks like trucks are all driving backwards in circles with those damn beepers flying around. All-non-stop. I was made insane before I began wearing ear plugs. I am dreaming like a newborn now. We saw no bugs or mice at all. The construction is immaculate! The hallways do not have any ripped wall paper. In the corners, no dust. No bad decoration jobs or uneven work on stone or tiles. Everything is washed, in working order and tastefully finished. When you have a problem, it is automatically taken care of. The building was completed in 2004 (I think) but, unlike many conversions downtown, it is new construction and designed for residential. Three elevators are available and you hardly wait longer than a minute. The doorman is supportive and knowledgeable. The facilities are clean and modern and include a swimming pool, sauna, gym, bike storage, luggage storage, 46th floor roof deck with all-day heat, children's playroom, nice laundry room (not used b/c, stackable washer/dryer). The amenities are clean and modern. The computers are high quality and they work. Call downstairs if anything does not fit, and they will be right there to repair it. Glenwood is a wonderful MGMT company. Competition will mean nothing bad for them, except there. They have negotiated on our rent for us repeatedly to keep us in the house. We spend well below fair value. There is a garage in the basement that has Zip automobiles and a Financier Pastry Shop on the first floor if you want to drive. On weekends or at night, I hear comments about the dull quiet downtown, but I personally think it's nice. I am surrounded by people when I go to Union Square now. Downtown is like a little community in a big city. Greatly manageable. It is a 10-15 minute walk to Whole Foods, but Gristedes and Zeytuna are within a mile. Stone Street is nearby. The seaport on South Street is Cose. It's similar to Battery Park. Governors Island Ferry, Ikea Ferry, Far Rockaway and New Jersey beach ferries are successful ferries. There are better places if you are young and are searching for a party. For mature individuals who want good quality and operation, this position is fine. More so than the young and hip, it still appears to cater more to the country club audience. This building is impenetrable if protection is significant! You can't get by the door boys, nobody will be fired here as happened at 2 Gold! Deliveries are escorted to your door! Some of the grievances I read are absurd! I've been in New York City for seventeen years and we love consistency. We'd linger here if we could buy a 2BR. 10 The oasis is Liberty Lane.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,Currently Living,,,4.21,3.06,B,100%,10

The building isn’t very clean- no obvious mess, but isn’t disinfected much and whatever they clean with stinks. Noise also carries EVERYWHERE, and in an extreme, more-than-normal-NYC way. Some of the choices contractors made are head scratchers- French doors that open in instead of out, making an already-small bedroom (most in the building are 8x11) feel even smaller; tubs with half-glass doors that make it unreasonable to have a shower curtain but also do nothing to prevent water getting everywhere.

Also heads up! There are rent-stabilized units in this building, so be sure to ask about that when considering putting in an application.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,4.50,5.12,A,99%,1

- cheaper than average rent for 3/4 bedroom apts in the neighborhood
- central air
- lots of natural light in most rooms since it's corner building
- pet friendly
- 420 friendly
- 1 block from major train station but you cant hear the train in the apt
- prime location
- no person under age of 18 in the building (although some residents sure act like they are...)

Cons:
- shootings between gangs and drug dealers is real and happens on this street often
- before COVID, groups of men (sometimes 15+) hang out in front the deli around the corner 24/7 and LOVED to blast music from their car, boombox, phones. Cannot ask them to stop because they are the ones dealing drugs and shooting people. The police department knows all about their activities and were inactive until there was 3 shootings within a month after a year worth of shootings and gang activities.
- no laundry in building, there is one across the street but it is RATCHET. <---understatement, must see to believe (crackheads chill spot, DIIIIIIRTY, not )
- the super is rude, unresponsive and absent. Lived here for 3 years and never seen him, you would need to call the mgnt company to get any response.
- building is cheap from the walks to the appliances to the patch up work
- mice live in this building as well

Started with a strong boss and Mega, and a fantastic and polite management. Soon after Super resigned, Mike, the maintenance boss, became Super. I consider these the days of glory. Mike was an extremely compassionate, affectionate, insightful man. Just so similar to too many of us. Everything shifted then. I'm not sure whether it was the business of mgmt or what, but the building fell under new mgmt, and from there things went downhill. Management continued to vanish one by one, both being shot or ""transferred"" to other shady buildings. They have been advised not to be too chummy. They were convicted and shot for ludicrous crimes. In contrast to before we arrived here, the exterior of the house is in relative shambles. In the front of the house, there are planters full of dead trees toppled all over. The front door and the entire area are coated and caked in dog piss layers that are never tidied up and stink. Popular spaces are still dirty (hallways, elevators, public restrooms). There were a few porters we used to have here who took care of garbage, tidying, and so much more. We have one right now, because he's here all the time and he's overworked. There was no one else to move the trash from the basement to the curb on one of the few days when he wasn't here, so the interior of the house wreaked hot garbage for a whole week. We've wanted to leave last year in the four years we've been here, but we're having a rough time because we own a really large dog and houses that would make it hard to find. It was during our rental year that we found a spot. We were trying to hammer out an understanding with mgmt, but they were deceptive, evasive and hostile. Finally, if someone leased our house, they promised to let us out and that they would prove it. It wasn't seen once for five weeks, and they eventually told us they would screen it only if there weren't any other apts to show, and only if they had a walk-in (they would not advertise it).

The amenities included central air in every room, dishwasher, gas stove, huge bathtub, laundry in the basement, and modern finishes. The rooms are a bit on the small side, but I was able to fit a queen bed, dresser, bookcase, small desk, and thin closet in my room. This is also not a true two bedroom as one room has foldable/removable walls/doors, though since the glass on the doors was opaque there were no privacy issues. There are also no built-in closets, though we were provided with a thin and tall closet with a mirror door for each bedroom. While the backyard is not as tidy and overrun by mosquitoes due to the overgrown yard next door, the roof features one of the best skyline views in the whole city. The area is overall quiet and the windows block out a lot of sound. I've always felt safe walking home at night and it's a short walk to the L train. There are two grocery stores close by and many local restaurants, cafes, and bars in the area. My biggest complaint would be the management's response to issues in the apartment. I often had to follow up multiple times to have repairs made or appliances checked out. Despite this, the apartment was lovely to live in and truly  fantastic for the cost of monthly rent.",,X,X,X,X,4,4,N,N,Y,2 bedroom,Currently live here,3-4 years,Front,4.83,4.10,A,95%,1

The apartment has quite a bit of room for an NYC studio. Also, the outdoor space sure was nice during the beginning of the Pandemic. And the new laundry room (updated right before I left) is super nice. The fact the machines can text you when they're done is helpful. The best thing tho is the location. Near tons of food and about 45 seconds from the Q.

The bad:
If you're on the first or second floor it's loud as hell. The hallways echo, the stairs are loud, and the doors are hollow + not sealed well. Plus I could hear every step from the upstairs apartment. Because of the location of the kitchen, the second you even put a slight char on something the apartment fire alarm goes off. The building-wide alarm even went off several times due to apartments just cooking food. Not even burning, just cooking. That all equals a very loud apartment at all times of day/night. I've lived in many loud apartments, this was the loudest.  Also, the drainage in the bathroom is pretty poor.

Let’s start with the positives. The apartment is large with massive bedrooms (each over 160 sqft) and well priced. The rooftop is also a nice addition, and the property is located nearby the train at 116th. Beyond that I don’t have much else positive to share. The landlord does not care about the property and will do anything to save money. The place is infested with rodents, and we were forced to pay for our own extermination (an expense of nearly $1K). We had an exterminator come at least 20 times and despite doing all they could we still had the problem. The landlord sends her college aged son instead of professionals to fix things. While he is friendly, he does not have the skill set to fix things. The heat in 2 bedrooms is broken and was never fixed; the landlord instead provides space heaters. The rooms get so cold without the heaters that you can see your breath. At one point we had to call the city due to the inhabitable conditions. The oven is also broken, and since it’s such a challenge to get things fixed we just purchased a toaster oven to use instead. We also were told by con Edison that the stove was not put in properly and is leaking gas. Despite raising the alarm this was also never fixed. The pipes do not function properly. The toilets do not flush properly and the tubs/sinks do not drain properly. The landlord insists on using draino to fix these issues, but we’ve contracted our own professional who told us it is likely a problem with the entire plumbing system. As a result of the broken plumbing, we have an issue with bugs and pests that feed on the biofilm (the exterminator we contracted told us this). There are moths everywhere, small ant-like bugs, flies and others that pop up from time to time. The stairs are another safety hazard on the property and have been broken for 2 years. Guests often fall up or down them due to the steep incline and 1-2 steps that are angled improperly. I myself have also fallen and injured myself; I worry about  anyone who has to climb up or down them. We constantly find ourselves warning people “watch the steps”. I won’t get into the details on how the property is not secured, as to protect the safety of those who inhabit it. Overall, you really do get what you pay for. I’d warn other tenants of the issues I mentioned.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,3.68,4.56,A,98%,2

A couple months back, I swear one of the apartments in this building was an Airbnb. There are stray cats that lay on the stoop that are harmless/cute and take care of any rats and mice, until you realize that they will never leave (stare inside the building's glass door), and are a huge target for the dogs in the building. The management company owns several buildings on the block, and one super is in charge of maintaining them. That leaves a lot of work for one guy, and the garbage that flows in through the sidewalks isn't part of that. Walk a block over and you can really see the bigger picture of the lack of maintenance that the city has already fined them for. ConEd also always has trouble getting in to read the meters for whatever reason, so expect a random higher bill when they finally can read and assess properly.

The lobby and the hallways are lovely. Yeah, those are the positive ones. The terrible thing is that mgmt is really misleading about the amount of work that is going on in the house. Since they want to sell locations that mix places and renovate them in the house, making life unbearable for someone who works at home or needs to spend time at home with young children. They never warn anybody about it until they rent it, so the house is overflowing with hundreds of disgruntled renters seeking to move to other locations in the building to avoid the work that goes on for five days a week. If you think you'd get away from the chaos and head up to the Oasis club (the name of the health club lounge on the roof), you'd better be prepared to pay a lot of money. The cost is $5,000 per pair, or $3600 per user. And for this fee, you're going to get obnoxious people that they're running the most exclusive spa in NY.

It’s one block from one of the best entryways into Central Park, which is a major perk.  The management company is fine, though I think the rent is a bit high for a brownstone without any amenities. Anyone coming from the doorman/luxury building experience might like the quiet anonymity. The floors of the building are sinking toward the back left corner of the building, so be prepared to do things to level your furniture.  Appliances are 3/4 apartment size.  No laundry in building. Some visiting roaches on the parlor level, so I imagine the ground floor and beneath are much worse. Love the high ceilings, but those can be found on the UWS frequently. I wouldn’t move back to that apartment or building, but it served its purpose for the time I had to be there.

Unnecessary big building (nearly 2 years worth) was hell and transformed a once magnificent lobby into a freezing, gloomy, ugly, uninviting spot you can't wait to walk thru (blindfolded). But not only is the once spacious LAUNDRY ROOM the size of a wardrobe now. Bring in 4 people and you'll rub more than your knees. The (front load washers) are too close to the ground and the (dryers) are on top of them. It's also very rough on the back cuz' Not all the counters that used to be there. But the space formerly devoted to the laundry room has been filled up by mgmt's new leasing office. Everything tells you that. Since they use absolutely no water or detergent, their new WASHERS do not even wash the clothes. And whether you want Light Wash, it costs $3, which we don't recommend because that's even less! Residents have taken to posting comments in the elevators and they make you feel like you are the problem if you complain to mgmt. That's their way of avoiding the issue, because there's nothing they need to do. We learnt that some people have resorted to taking their laundry to the laundromat in the area. Everything tells you that. The ELEVATORS are wild. As their new computerized system keeps the 5 elevators on the higher floors, prepare to wait in line. During the AM/PM peak hours, don't be in a hurry. It's so embarrassing to see how long you can wait. My husband bruised his shin terribly twice when the elevator did not fit with the building. What a tragedy. We will appeal if it happens again. The front of the building and the lobby played ROCK MUSIC for months. Since then, the outside ""concert"" has been shut down and the inside lobby music has been replaced with jazz music (mostly). What did they think? The concern is with mgt. Don't say that. Anyone with a brain understands that music from one human is noise from another. Even the subway does not encourage music to be played. But at Avalon Midtown West, that's what you're going to see. Similarly, for all to hear day and night, hundreds of SPEAKERS and 3 FLAT SCREEN TVs now line the back terrace area. And believe us, we were in a friend's space with colleagues who overlooked the terrace. The months of summer are hell. Dozens of college aged children often fill up the terrace as if it were an all-day night pub. The noise is ludicrous. Is it the way you treat residents? And their dwellings? Wear headphones if residents wish to sit outside and watch whatever bullshit is on tv. Or better yet, Cram into their own apts and blow up the TV (or music) of their own and DRINK and Scream at each other before dawn for everyone cares. Leave everyone else out of it. At 10pm, the terrace is expected to close. That's just a prank. Mgt, mgt. It has a responsibility to provide shelter for tenants and do all they can to uphold the sanctity of residents' homes. Either that or the contract is broken. But are they interested in us? Hey, nope. All of this material is a representation of Avalon mgmt. And the new ones? We learn that the Bldg. has been prosecuted a few times. Why aren't we surprised? We plan to sell the Bldg. to get real grown-ups who know what they're doing to run the place. We're out of here after my husband's job deal is over. And don't get us started on the high rent paradise. And the undisclosed fees as you move-in or out. Complete irony.

In a more central area (i.e. not 4 avenues away from the closest subway), you can find similar places to rent (the 6 train on park). The units are fine on their own, with big windows, but one thing I've found is that they're very dirty, more than just a standard New York City apartment. If I vacuum, by the next day, I'll still have a thin layer of dust on the furniture (I am thinking this has something to do with the ventilation system in each unit). I'm tempted to say that one cool plus is that the landscaped roof has a wonderful view and is a good spot to hang out on good days. The doorman is all really well, but a lot of aspects are less than clear in the mgmt. For starters, the market valuation of the units is either delusional or flat-out. But for other reasons, I might have left this year, and I'll have to wait another year before I go. They still forget to note that your rent would grow from what your rent was before you signed up in July. Yeah, this clause is in the rental deal, but only to understand the language of the contract, you need a hidden decoder ring.

Basically, their toilets' narrow nature is such that you should not use anything other than the thinnest, cheapest single-ply TP, otherwise you Can obstruct the toilet.

I realize, but it would have been great to get some of the leasing benefits enjoyed by new residents. The leadership is very welcoming and welcoming (I would say that is one of the best features of the building). The only concern I have is that the laundry room is very poorly maintained; the machines are constantly disabled and I waste a lot of time trying to do laundry.

I have to admit that they're cool to keep up the appearance, but under the outside there are several faults that I'm going to mention below. Last of all, the first experience. During my apt hunting season, I phoned up and toured about 20 different apts with an emphasis on the mgmt houses. Leasing agent Larissa was very diligent in checking in with me (this may be attributed to the covid time because they had a number of tenants moving out) and eventually she not only gave me a bargain but even tried to obtain the furniture from the former occupant (thumbs up for that). But, after the contract was signed and I had concerns that I will describe below, emails to her were fully overlooked. Maintenance 1. 1. In general, I'd agree that their repair team is very swift to patch a vent with noisy noises or bulbs, but I guess it's the minimum for a building of mgmt. However, I had a water leak in my bathroom that was never cold, and it took me 1 month to get it worked out. Using the online service request didn't help, and I had to call a lot of times before they really took the trouble to do it. I had to contact the office repeatedly until they found out about the problem and resolved it. I suppose they were hoping that people would forget about it, but when you're rushing around in the morning and just have hot water to wash, it's not appropriate. Communication was bad, too, and the boss never reacted fast. Doorman 1. Doorman 1. Protection is bad, because someone might have went up to the apt unannounced. Most of the doormen, I suppose, are temporary as I keep seeing new faces, and their behaviour is just terrible. If they can't find your parcel, they're going to give you the one I don't bother with, and they're going to walk away from you. Summary This is what I would call a luxury building want tobe, they're great to keep up with appearances by being proactive at the beginning and decorating their lobby and making it look fine, but basically, it's a day to day life and fixing problems that concern. If you're dreaming of a luxurious apt with a decent operation, this isn't the place for you.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,Currently Living,,,4.36,3.06,A,100%,17

Pros:

- The lobby and hallways are generally kept clean.
- There's a laundry room in the basement and the washers/dryers were replaced in late 2020/early 2021.
- Public transportation options are good. Both the 8th Ave. and Fort Hamilton N stops are about 2.5 blocks away. The B9, B70, and B16 are all within a couple blocks.
- The neighborhood feels safe.

Cons:

- The super who was here when I first moved in left during COVID and his replacement isn't great. When I text about an issue he doesn't always respond and the garbage bins outside the laundry room often overflow. 
- The closest grocery stores might not have everything you want/need. I have to either get groceries delivered, take a car or public transportation, or walk about 25-30 minutes to the Bay Ridge or Borough Park Superfresh.
- Not sure if it's just extra loud neighbors or thin walls/floors but I can hear whenever the people upstairs and directly next to me watch TV or talk loudly.

Draw:

- There are a lot of restaurants within walking distance, but they're pretty much all Chinese food. If you want other cuisines you either have to have it delivered or walk a ways.",,,X,,X,5,3,N,N,Y,1 bedroom,Currently live here,1-2 years,Eastside,4.88,4.28,A,97%,1

Management is pretty responsive to any problems (though there seems to be a communication pipeline issue because problems aren’t always resolved on the first visit). Decent neighborhood. Walls and ceilings are very thin, and my upstairs neighbors were the WORST. So be aware that you will likely hear a lot from your neighbors (walking, stomping, voices, music, TV, etc).

There were also some drug addicts who were using in the lobby, but after the front door was replaced, it wasn’t an issue.

NOTE: Where it says, “Did you have a positive experience?” In the Q, it actually says, “Did you have a positive experience with neighbors?” So I said no. There’s a discrepancy between the Q when answering and the way it displays on the review end.

The good things are: the apartment was newly renovated when I arrived. When I went to see the apartment, I walked into them painting and installing new things. The only other tenants in the building live next door (it’s only 2 apartments in the whole building). The 1st floor is a Dominican deli called La Vakana, that serves hot sandwiches and have milk, eggs, plantains etc. About 3 blocks away, there’s a grocery store and train. Not the best store but you can find 2 more stores, 4 blocks in the opposite direction. Also 4 blocks away is a post office, dentist, food places, hair supply stores etc. A little of everything on Church Ave. Not the greatest stores (not MY style at least) but it’s nice to have. Parking is good up until 6 or 7 pm. Then good luck getting home and finding parking after 7pm. My 3 year old goes to an early learning school 3 blocks away from the house, close to the train and he lives it there. We love it too. It’s better than a babysitter and he’s learning so many things!! And I have a washer and dryer in my apartment, but that came after negotiations and threats to the landlord in the very beginning. We now have an understanding, I have new appliances and he’s been patient and accommodating since then. The negative things about the building and area are: the building is a bit old, even though the apartments are renovated, the hallway leaks if it rains and the lights in the hallway never work. (Electrical issues) changing the bulb only helps for a day and then they’re out again. BE CAREFUL NOT TO FALL DOWN THE STEPS. We’ve done that twice and tripped another 2 times. The living room doesn’t get enough light and the back room doesn’t either. The 2 front rooms do, which is nice for whomever lives in them. The rooms come in Large, Medium and small. The small room can fit a good about of furniture (including a full sized bed) but it’s narrow. Not much room to change up the room. However you first have it, it’ll stay. There are a few parks in the area, nothing close to the house, it’s a bit of a walk/drive. But if you have a bike it’s lovely. The neighborhood is funky, the neighbors in the surrounding buildings are loud and have motorcycles and 4wheelers and are up at all kinds of hours with their music. I’ve had to go down and yell at them to stop revving the engine to a bike at 11pm when my kid is asleep.

We've had loud neighbours sometimes, but nothing other than what goes with apt living. It was pleasantly mild in winter as well. An optional roach extermination service was offered by mgmt. This is excellent and has all the reasons that New York is loved by millions. It is hard handed and inflexible with mgmt. For several months before I left in December 2004, apt bathrooms were being renovated in the house. Tenants were told that for 5 days they would not have access to their bathroom and were advised to consider using a local fitness center. Since I took a position north of Boston, I quit. That didn't matter to mgmt, and they gave no choice other than to pay the lease until the end or until they find another renter to leave the lease amicably.

Unfortunately, you still get what you pay for in Manhattan.
 
 1) This building is advertised as a doorman's building, but the doorman is worthless. They will not allow deliveries and are also actually not at the door to raise safety issues. Luckily, the downtown is comparatively secure.
 
 2) The lifts are a disaster. They've got to be the worst, oldest elevators in NYC, and I don't think I'm exaggerating. They look like they're from 1950 and they're moving up at a pace of around 3-4 seconds/floor, which doesn't sound like a lot, but if you live on the 16th floor, you can add 3-5 minutes to your trip while you wait for the elevator to carry a person down and get back for you. Even this wouldn't be bad if mgmt didn't openly lie about replacing them. During the summer signals went up that the elevators would be replaced by a phase beginning in the fall. Nothing has begun on this front and this is going to happen. Apparently, they did this last summer when, coincidentally, lease renewals usually took place.
 
 3) Repair is shoddy. Paint fades, gaps are evident, and the general appearance of the halls and lobby is at best dingy. The water had gone out of this house, and mgmt wanted to blame municipal services who didn't operate anywhere near the water line. Aside from that, nearly every weekend at 9 a.m., the jackhammer goes off, which is really irritating, but not the fault of the house.
 
 The great thing about this location is that the apts are very spacious, as is always the case downtown. Apart from that, this house leaves a lot to be desired.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,Currently Living,,,3.94,4.44,A,100%,3

Noise is the result—and plenty of it. In this house, the walls between units are solid, so sound does not move sideways.

For the remainder of 2020, we recently moved to be with family while the course is run by Covid-19. We plan to be back in town in 2021, and we plan on going back to 70 Pine when we return! Upon entering the building you are greeted with the stunning and historic Art Deco theme. With key fob feedback and concierge 24/7, you feel safe. The services are magnificent. Our studio was very spacious and had a wide entrance and a terrace. The noise level was low and it was still fixed within a couple of hours any time we had a repair order (we had very minor things fixed for general upkeep). Also, the location is nice since so many trains are so close to it. We can quickly get to midtown and Brooklyn as well. For dinner and drinks, we liked being able to stroll to Stone Street or the South Seaport district. Lastly, the process was too easy when we moved out. We called the leasing office, told them of our intentions, arranged the service elevator and movers, and had a final stroll before returning keys through our apt, all while working with some of the finest people who work for Rose Associates!

We wanted to earn exactly that when we discovered Ocean Comfort apts, but still found we overpaid for the bare minimum. This place is the equivalent to visiting an expensive diner where you step through a stunning facade and entrance, are enthusiastic about all the possibilities and notice that your waiter ignores you all night, your meal is overcooked and in limited quantities, and a 20 percent tip is immediately added to a table of two. Before coming here, here are a few facts you should be aware of: -mgmt - I need to book an elevator today, as an example. There are 4 people whose role is to manage the office of mgmt, all with dedicated extensions. Throughout the day, between 9 am and 6 pm, I called both of them a total of 30 times. No one caught up. The voicemails were all complete. Question yourself, if you failed to answer the telephone at your workplace, would you last long? -Rent, precisely rises in rent - This year, how much did your rent increase? Just less than 5%? In New York City, what is the average increase? You would be right if you said 3 percent. How far has Ocean raised rent by 23 percent this year? Well, yeah, it's a double-digit figure. Most individuals upgrade and get an extra room for the price that Ocean is paying us for the same spot. Elevator - For about 30 minutes, I had one buddy get lost and locked on the elevator. Two elevators are available but would not carry you to those floors. Over the last 12 months, each has been elevated to mgmt. The elevators have been fixed, nope. -Roofdeck - Accessible for just nearly 6 months of the year, closing in October, just before snow falls. You pay for something that you don't have half the time to use. -Gym - This stinks. Horrible. Like, very bad. And wait before you find out how broken or dangerous a piece of machinery is. There are plans, once again, to repair or update something. Yeah, the house will cost money and they're not in the habit of investing it. -Free Sunday Brunch - First I need to get them, brunch = breakfast + lunch, by definition. Around 7:30 AM, nobody eats brunch. That aside, yes, it's a wonderful and amazing brunch. Yeah, by the way, you've already been at the thunderdome, so you'd better be primed for war if you want some of those tasty scones and orange juice. Quite possibly, the first 3 or 4 individuals in line have a little orphan family living with them and they can snatch one of those breakfast goodies to feed 20 and leave you with crumbs. Brunch""Brunch"" It's guaranteed to be history in 10 minutes. -Building. 1) Walls Will the neighbours like to watch television? You get to listen to television for them now. There's a puppy the neighbours like to have. You've got a puppy now. Your neighbor gets into some nasty freak stuff at 2 AM, so you're a friend.Maybe it's going to grow on you. There's always a chance to grow in existence. 2) Fire Alarms - can detect something, even whether something is not cooked or finished. 3) Sinks and Faucets - spit out muddy water sometimes. It's a special trait. We were told to get out of the water and that it would go down. Uh, sweet! - Washer/Dryer - Two were down, never repaired, all year round. It's also pricey. -Front Desk: These guys are cool, and I want to buy a beer for them.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,4.67,4.65,A,97%,16

Cue the horror. Once summer weather is over & the weather starts to cool down you will notice that the apartment is freezing cold & you cannot warm it at all. Tenant pays for the heat & electricity btw. This caused me to have to pay $250+ in Con Edison bills almost every month except in June, July, & August. It's like this literally year round until it's summer again. & if you think you'll get a nice hot shower when you get home form work, think again. The water is warm, not hot, AT ALL for like 15 mins, then it slowly gets cooler. 

Do you like animals? How about mice? This apartment is on the ground floor & gets alot of mice. I've had to throw away so many sticky traps with dead & live mice on them. This is not something I wanted to do but I had no choice because management wouldn't help. One day while I was out, I came home & noticed maggots in front of my door & some inside my apartment. There were upwards of 20 half dead & some completely dead flesh flies allover the place thanks to my cats. Who would also kill mice from time to time. I have no idea where they came from but this happened several times during the summer.
Let's not forget the water leaks. There were water leaks in about 3 or 4 places including one in the MIDDLE OF MY LIVINGROOM because the neighbor upstairs' bathroom is directly above it, so that was the worst one. It left disgusting yellow stains on the ceilings.

During the winter time I had to walk around in hoodies, sweat pants, & thick socks in my own apartment which really sucked because I actually like spending time at home but I would leave to my boyfriend's whenever I could to get some warmth. 

There was also a HUGE leak in front of my apartment one night during the winter which left very thick ice in front of my door. Dealing with management was also terrible beacause whenever I called or texted them about these issues, it took them forever to address anything. 

I could go on forever but I'll stop here. Please avoid this place if you can. It caused me so much emotional stress. All the money spent here is not worth it.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,3.73,4.05,A,88%,1

It was a horrible experience. I am writing this to help other potential prospects and to protect them so no one has to go through what I went through.  

1. The management company (First Service Residential) does not manage. I am shocked there aren't any lawsuits against this management company. Everyone should check out their Yelp reviews. They have zero Stars because they do not manage. They collect and disappear as soon as one signs the lease.

2. There was a bed bug infestation. I reached out to the management company repeatedly for help, and no one responded. My neighbor reached out as well.  She had hundreds of bite marks all over her body. The repeated attempts for help went on for quite some time. I sent repeated emails for help and no one at the management company responded.  They received my voicemails and completely ignored me. At the end, I threw out all my furniture and lost 10K in new furniture that I brought when i moved in. Plus, my neighbor had a leaky ceiling for 12 months and they never fixed it. They moved out with a huge hole in their ceiling. Can you imagine? A giant hole for 12 months of living there.

3. The super does not clean the apartment complex on a frequent basis. Hallways are extremely dirty and dark and there aren't any light bulbs in the hallway. There isn't enough lighting.

4. The tenants in the building have been there for over 50 years. Their rent is dirt cheap. However, they are not the most professional, courteous, or cleanliest of people.  They'll leave pizza boxes at their front door to bring roaches in. Its sad because they literally ruin the place. Almost like pissing on the floor of your own home. They ruin it for everyone including themselves and will never move out because they can't afford real rent if they leave. 

5. There is a tenant in the building that gets drunk several times a week and starts singing in front of the building. I came out one time and found him asleep on the floor. I thought he was unconscious and dead. It was very alarming and not upscale at all. 

6. No laundry in the building. It's not cute going outside in the winter time to wash clothes.

7. No elevator. You're out of luck if you have to walk up to the 4th floor.

8. Lousy management company, lazy super, and horrible neighbors, and high rent (close to 2K for a 1 bedroom) in a 100 year old red brick building that offers nothing and zero amenities means this place is NOT a WINNER! Steer clear and don't do it to yourself. People work too hard to pay high rents and deal with this nonsense.

The only pros are:
1. Train is 1 block away. Easy commute into Manhattan. 
2. The neighborhood itself is not bad.
3. The young working professionals in the building save this place, but everyone leaves after 1 year so the high class-ness of it goes back down to negative 500.
4. It's rent stablized.
5. They do gut renovate when people move out so new tenants can literally have a high end unit with stainless steel appliances, new floors and a new bathroom, but it's at a premium cost for close to 2K when everyone else with a busted unit pays $500.00 a month.

All of this is allegedly. The entire review is allegedly for safety reasons and to protect myself. Check out their Yelp reviews.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,3.39,4.22,A,98%,1

The design pays for what you get quite reasonably, I have seen even smaller apts for one bedroom, go for much much more in doorman houses. My one bedroom offers more than ample space for an L-shaped area in the living room, and a complete dining room table with 6 chairs without feeling like the living space is cluttered or crowded. The bedroom is small, but a queen size bed and full size dresser with space to spare will comfortably match. There are enough closets - two closets in the bedroom and four in the living room offer more than adequate space. My kitchen is freshly renovated with materials of high quality. The leadership was nothing but friendly to me, and very supportive when needed (although without being declared, the doorman does not always seem to stop people coming in). The laundry room in the building is spacious enough, and they were replaced immediately the few occasions the washers/dryers were out of operation. Also, the facility is very clean. Personally, I have never had any trouble with the construction company mgmt, and I contacted Lori or Rebecca the few times I had questions and they replied the same day. To expand on a couple of the other remarks, yes, the hallways are dim (who cares?), yes, the AC in the building is not the finest (but it does the job), the person moaning about the diner was actually over it personally because I never stinked it (my apt is midway up the building, but that goes for the lobby as well).",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,4.29,4.67,A,99%,12

Hardwood floors, a dishwasher, double vanity, and five closets. I’ve lived there for almost four years. The stairs are very narrow and there’s no elevator, so it is a major pain bringing luggage up and down as well as groceries and laundry. There’s some public housing across the street but I’ve never had any problems or really felt unsafe at night, but I do wish I were a few streets down. The management company is the worst part. They aren’t terrible, but it’s been very hard to get them to make repairs. When we had a mouse, they sent someone fairly quickly to find any holes and they patched them up and we didn’t have a problem after that. But other repairs are difficult to get fixed, like when we’ve had plumbing issues. The worst part is when it comes to laundry. We do have laundry in the next building (you have to go out the door and down the stairs to the next building’s basement which is annoying), but they took it away in October or November of 2019 because it needed to get “repaired” and it’s literally September 2020 now as I write this and it still hasn’t been fixed even though I’ve written about it several times to them. So while I like my apartment, I know now the importance of having an elevator and better laundry, and the management company could definitely be more responsive.

I put in a repair request and explicitly said in the directions that if I was not present and that I would like to be present, I would NOT give them permission to access my house.

They are the organization I have ever worked with that is most inept, indifferent and generally uninterested. It was fairly straightforward to work with previous mgmt businesses at 63 Wall Street; I have never faced any of the challenges I face now. I'm going to start by saying that Pinnacle did an excellent job renovating the bar, spa, rooftop and speakeasy. In this sense, they unquestionably changed the building for the best and, frankly, this is a big reason I haven't moved out yet. Yeah, we were originally assured that these facilities will be included in the rent, and now we are being paid for using them (including the use of the gym, but the capacity of the gym is still there), but that's not a major deal for me.For \ For me, what is a bigger challenge is living in a ""luxury"" home, paying top dollar and being deprived of essential needs such as air conditioning, electricity, hot water, water in general, and gas, most recently. What's worst is the households or their essential needs was mgmt's failure to think for it. In the season, for a week and a half, we didn't have air conditioning. My husband and I live on the 15th floor, and since we were unable to live in our flat, we had to drive to and from my family's home in Pennsylvania every day. We were not given a cut in rent, or a grant to stay in a hotel. Mgmt just said ""they didn't realize"" that it would be too hot when they were making renovations (it was the summer - come on) and that ""their hands were tied."" I know there are a lot of tenants to fit in the house, but this is an inappropriate response indeed. Nearly every week, the water is shut off. Most lately, we went without hot water for a couple days and got the gas switched off in the house for almost three weeks now. Again, it's New York and this happens, but the manner in which mgmt deals with it is utterly important to alter residents. We eat out every day now, we have to throw food out, we can't do our laundry in the house, and mgmt just tells us this is the way it is. We were advised the petrol wouldn't be back until at least March 15, so we haven't been and won't be able to cook or do laundry for half of March and the last week of February. Again, there were no rent concessions offered. We were given a hot plate by mgmt when mgmt eventually replied, but then we were told they were literally running out of them. Incredible. Apart from being restored, the house remains like a landfill. For over a month, caution tape was stretched over the front door with a taped piece of scrap paper with the words ""door broken, use other door."" scribbled in permanent marker. While for a ""exclusive luxury building,"" this is completely inappropriate, this did not bother me initially. But this was rendered even more irritating to me by the other problems. Mgmt does not force the diners to pick up their litter outside, and in the summer rodents and cockroaches run wild on the sidewalks. Out there, there is essentially an infestation. The back door is still open because they fail to repair it, and I found the cockroaches have already made their way into the building's interior. All the time I've been here, I've never seen anything like this. The fact that the elevators free fall is my favourite. You heard me, yeah. We've been in the elevator twice so, where the terror status tower actually fell. The first time this happened, we were meeting friends who would never return. It was with fellow tenants the second time this occurred. Some residents have told us that this has also happened to them. Actually, the elevator will plunge about 8 feet, shoot up 2, and then drop another 6-7 floors again. We told MGMT, and we never got a reply. The doorman told us this is because the cold air falls in and there is no revolving door and the elevator is caused by a fault in the way the lobby was designed (there was some technical reasoning behind this). He said that MGMT was aware of this. What's more irritating is that mgmt consistently charges us for payments that are not disclosed. We're told it's a mistake when we inquire about them, because it's auto-generated. For the last 4 months or so, this has appeared every month. We're also frequently paid with failing to provide protection for the renter. We have been paid 3 times already for that. It's ironic because, like me, my father runs an insurance firm and has emailed several times about our scheme. All in all, it's a terrible shame because the doorman is good (especially Jay and Carmen), the handymen are good (especially Lionel), the area is good, the lounge and services are good, and the bar manager is good for Jessie and the rest of the speakeasy management. I just hope the mgmt will step up and start caring for its people because it's a nice place to live, but they're just bad.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,Currently Living,,,2.87,3.06,B,100%,11

(3) In reality, Monaco, the building manager, is very good at working with. When we had a dispute with the upstairs renters and their new speaker system, they worked specifically with the question of tenants. They were usually polite and made phone calls back. (4) This is a nice place. I'm driving around and the East Village is my dream place to work. (5) Perfect access to the metro. (6) The walls are thick. Most of the time, I have never noticed neighbours on our floor. (7) I never had a problem with the availability of the laundry room. (8) The house is well maintained. It has been recently renovated. The flowers are cultivated in the spring and summer months. CONS: (1) The main thing is that the floors of our unit were incredibly rugged and exaggerated footsteps. We haven't learned this until after the lease was signed, so it may have been a dealbreaker. Any night, I had to sleep with earplugs. I assume that some units are worse off than others. (2) The environment is fairly college-y-a lot of students in the building and NYU dorms in the vicinity.

The apartments in this house...
The landlord doesn’t fix much, everything is patch work. The foundation of the house is cracked leaving the entire house on a slant. The first floor apartment has no closet space and the upstairs apartment is outdated. The backyard and front of the house is not kept well.  There are multiple sinking areas in the backyard and chipped cement. The landlords are not flexible with rent even during the year of the pandemic. Walls are very thin so you hear everything. Downstairs tenants have said they can hear every footstep upstairs neighbors make.  Walls are also very thing, you can hear the TV between the floors even on the lowest volume
There has been an issue with the electrical outlets not working, which we told to the landlord only for them to hand us a heavy duty extension cord and told us plug everything into that.  The overhead light in our child's bedroom was an exposed live wire running from an outlet.  The city came in and deemed it a fire hazard and told them to remove it.  We were promised by the landlord that they would replace it with a proper overhead light, two years ago and it never happened.
There is a constant heating issue throughout the house, where the heat doesn't always work and the apartment becomes cold.  It has been reported to the landlord several times only for them to ""come take a look"" and tell us everything is fine.  We bought digital thermometers for entire house that records data to show them how cold it gets.  One weekend it was between 48 -54 degrees in the house and we texted and asked them to please turn on the heat.  They ignored us and have yet to fix the heating issue to this day.  They said to our face they know what the problem is but it is too expensive to fix.  Naturally we were upset and told them that is unacceptable and that they need to fix the heat.  This resulted in the owners significant other/maintenance guy screaming in my husbands face and saying racial slurs about us being jewish.  We have had to invest in electric heaters for each room, which has made our electricity bill sky high as well as the circuit breaker keeps tripping because of us using some much power to keep the house warm enough for our family.  There was a day we woke up to no power around 6 am and we messaged and call the landlord multiple times to please come reset the breaker (there is no access to it) as our child needed to do remote learning and I needed to work from home.  It took them close to 9 hours to respond and come reset it.  So we were freezing with no power, I had to call out of work and my child missed an entire day of school.  One of the bedrooms (which we turned into a closet since there is only one small closet in the apartment) has no heating source whatsoever.
They randomly installed cameras all around the property without warning.  One of the cameras is pointing directly into our child's bedroom.  My child has expressed it makes them feel uncomfortable and we have asked nicely for them to please move the camera to a different side so that it does not look in the direction of the bedroom window and the landlord responded by slamming doors in my face while talking to them and refusing to move it.  They also installed a security camera pointing at a mirror $20 from target above the front door.  It does not capture who comes in and out of the front door but what is happening down the hall at our apartment front door inside of the house.  It is also a safety hazard as the mirror is not securely on the wall and moves every-time we go out of the main front door of the house.  It is about to fall any minute.  We have asked them to please remove the mirror as well only for them to continue to ignore us.  The cameras were only installed after the other tenants moved out almost a year ago so it was directed to make us uncomfortable.  No one has moved into the other apartment yet.  Police were called and even the officers told them the mirror is a hazard and the way the cameras are positioned it is inappropriate/an invasion of privacy.  I have heard them say the cameras are there for safety to potential new tenants, but it is only there for them to see and hear what you are doing.
As great of a neighborhood as this is and the great potential this house has, the landlord is rude, disrespectful and does not want to fix anything without a fight about it.
Otherwise the house is a great size. Nice neighbors and neighborhood. Great school district.  Walking distance to some supermarkets, not the best, but doable.  Watch out for the Ctown on Metropolitan, they tend to leave expired products on the shelves for sale.  It is sad that it is a nightmare to live in this apartment/house and deal with this landlord because the neighborhood is so nice and family friendly.",,,,X,,4,4,Y,Y,Y,3 bedroom,,,,3.75,3.57,A,84%,1

I moved in at $950.00 in Spring 0f 1995 and my final rent was equivalent to $1300.00 when I vacated in late Spring 2005. Except for the 2 PH units, which are like 4 rooms with terraces, the house is all alcove studios. In the house, there is no electricity, all units are electric combo heat/A/C and all units have electric stoves. The A/C units - the original units since the building opened in 1988 - are very old and usually perform poorly. The windows are vertical sliders that have no displays and no real means of building your own drag-and-drop A/C machine. With the A/C machine, I struggled and arranged to have it tidied and upgraded myself, for which the landlord declined to pay. It really wanted the device to be replaced. There are just 2 washers and 2 dryers for the whole building and they are Pace Queens, who only swing around the filthy water and never clean the clothing. The laundry room is pointless. The positive news - since most residents send their washing out, you will typically get a computer. Pets are permitted, and in the sister building down the block - 309 W 30 Street, there is a super who lives. The other sister building is 337 W 30th on the block. In the late 90s, the block began to really improve for the positive, but by 2005 life began to get back to sketchy again - as the beat cops were torn down by Midtown South - the area precinct. When I first came in, we were given a particular beat officer. His name was Billy Melendez, or something like that. All in all, I would suggest the units, but not if you are forced to buy and pay a broker fee over $1500.00. It's hard to park on the street because it can be loud if you live in front of you. The next shop at 341 West 30 St was a halfway house/crack house that wasn't there when I first moved in; it arrived late - in 2002. It was formerly full of older maritime veterans who became almost invisible, but finally died off. The owner of the building was reluctant to sell it, so he worked out a contract with Malibu Hotels Corp and for 28 - 30 days they relocated to recover addicts/AIDS patients. With these supposed recovered addicts still selling cocaine out of the windows of the house, it was a very temporary form of atmosphere. For most of the block, it was a nightmare, unaware whether it had been fixed. Until all hours of the night, they were hanging out on the stoop, and the police were nowhere to be seen. This undoubtedly deterred all the good sides of the block and the city and undid it. There were drug houses in 1995, which vanished in the late 1990s, but this one was a nightmare indeed. Before renting, I will search the block and pay particular attention to 341 and what it is being used for now.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,5+ years,,3.09,4.19,B,98%,1

The apt we have is a little small-I don't know what the other apts look like, but as this was initially an office house, they might be larger ( however on the positive, the roofs are high because of it). A couple hundred metres away, there is a convenience store, but it is overpriced. On each floor, there are rooms for laundry. Horrible points: we don't have a motorcycle, but given that the road is still full of parked vehicles in front of it, I guess it would be very tough to get parking spaces.

I would have offered 3.5 or even 4 stars to be honest, even a year or two earlier, but alas, here we are. The management (maintenance, box room management, doorman, etc.) is really nice and couldn't work harder, and the subways nearby are fantastic. But for the rest, ugh. One of the worse things is not necessarily their fault, but the loudest streets on the UES (several local hospitals/fire stations, where sirens blare interminably as they wait in gridlock traffic) have to be 95th/96th & 2nd/3rd. Before this, I lived in Midtown, and somehow it's louder on 96th Street (must be the proximity to hospitals). Then, with the services it has, the building is now just plain over-capacity-TOO MANY PEOPLE and wayyy TOO FEW ELEVATORS (knock on wood, but we will all die in an emergency), too little (functional) washer/dryers, etc. As rents have increased, more residents in each apartment have been stuffing (""flexing"") more people. In the elevator, each person has to suit. With a puppy of theirs (s). Even gigantic strollers for kids. Several times a day. While they upgraded the elevators a few years ago, the wait can easily be 10+ minutes at busy hours, even though none are broken down. Perhaps worst, they take an elevator out of operation any time someone transfers (frequent in a building w/ 1500+ apartments, even more frequent now that things have gone to hell) for that, and the delay is much longer. On the tour, the gym (which you pay extra for) looks great, but is often HOT (ew) & sometimes very busy, especially in the evenings. Much of the devices are working, but very dated (and actually sticky lol, sticky they tidy, but it's just not enough). The apts themselves are all right. They actually look pretty fine, but there are clearly items they have cheaped out on: the wood floors are not at all robust, very easily they get squeaky and sometimes even broken.The A/C window systems still work reasonably well but are straight out of 1995 and can not be set/adjusted (there is technically a dial, so it is basically either 'on' or 'off', i.e. freezing or sweating, so you can get up many times a night to turn on/off/back on before you die - they are also not the least bit enee- Look, I'm not really that high maintenance, so most of these stuff I will (and have) stick with for a price, but that's not their cost, unfortunately. I don't know how much my rent is going to rise this year, but either way, I'm gone. Rents are now high past what they deserve to be (I know because I occasionally look at other listings while waiting 15 mins for my elevator lol). My neighbors down the street, who were lovely and just moved last year, told me their rent went up to $400 this month (!!!!!). No reason to say why they're getting out. Yeah, there are locations in New York City that can comfortably get $3,700 for a one-bedroom, but one of them is not 96th & 2nd. Not one of them is this house.

Because of the inability to utilize the once prime-location neighborhood as much, my roommates and I are staying home more often. The sun-soaked rooms of my Brooklyn apartment are comforting. People-watching outside my along 5th avenue is interesting. My favorite part of the house is the kitchen. Large and communal, with a kitchen island and a solid stove, great room to see the sunrise and sunset on the fire escape. However, staying at home more made me more aware of the overall architecture of the apartment. How the super long hallways cause a home to have slower wi-fi, and it's even slower because we're all working from home more. A 4-floor walkup is quite steep to navigate, it makes you less inclined to go outside when you can. My bedroom is quite large for New York City standards, you could really build out a personal studio in here! Future tenants should also keep in mind the balance of choosing a large room in a 4-floor walkup though. It will make building out your large space a bit harder. Using our cleaning services has been more difficult because of Covid-safety. It would be nice to have a landlord who is more understanding of and responsive to the changes in living situation when tenants have to live at home more often. The advice I would give to future tenants and people looking for an apartment is to learn about the landlord and the reason why he chose to build a community there. The neighborhood is slowly getting more bustling as things start to open up, but make sure you learn about how it feels to enjoy the home itself before just relying on a prime neighborhood.",,X,,,,4,2,Y,Y,Y,3 bedroom,Currently live here,Less than 1 year,Westside,3.94,3.92,A,100%,1

A quality grocery store is not in sight. There is nothing that can be considered a neighborhood in this area, and definitely nothing that caters to this building's tenants. It is a very filthy spot that I am afraid of taking visitors to. The number one reason we are terminating the lease is the low quality of the location. Overall, the house is very stunning and majestic inside. We were initially impressed once inside by the tranquil, spa-like environment. At first, management appears competent and then you find that others are really very lazy and tend to do nothing if they don't feel like it. The walls are really small, so you can hear all the sounds from your neighbours and from the corridor. There are occasional difficulties of hot water not being available and not operating well with heating and air conditioning. Overall, beautiful facilities, but plenty of dumb restrictions on the use of spaces (i.e. the theater and meeting rooms have to be rented), and the lounge room is kept positively cold, deterring the use of it as a place for gathering or relaxing.

While there, I noticed a doorman attempting to uncharacteristically unlock doors for individuals - that was because the leasing agents showed possible renters a suit. I only kept thinking that the individuals would be frustrated if they made the error of moving into these overcost apts. The new Superintendent is doing a little more than the previous superintendent and does not appear to appreciate tenant care. The Super is unable to get his management to keep the hallways cleaner or the recycling bins or garbage rooms regularly cleaned out. And the main problem that ALL residents find is that only ONE ELEVATOR is available at night (at prime hours) so the management uses the other service elevator - the wait can be as long as 15 minutes for an elevator at 8 pm!

Joe, the super, the sad excuse for a human being, is a wretched POS. Basically, he's the one who makes the decision to jack up your deposit. 5. Be sure all backups of the checks are kept handy. Steven (stephen?) G., (Greensburg, Glansberg forgets exactly), they're going to deposit them, so they're not going to credit you with them, and sue you. 6. In order to try to get their way, the mgmt has no trouble breaking the rules. They told me they weren't renewing my lease and were going to throw me out a couple of weeks before my lease was up, in flagrant defiance of the landlord-tenant laws of NYC. 7. The building has an inane strategy of forbidding persons from using the normal door to step in or out. Take a side door, go down the elevator to the basement, bring your things through the building, and get back up the elevator.

Located in the heart of Clinton Hill, it became a refuge to me, a longtime Harlem resident. 213 Taaffe Place sits across the street from a delightful little coffee shop, where I would sit with my espresso on Saturday mornings. On the corner is a C-Town market. I haven’t had such a convenient grocery walk since! It’s also only a few blocks away from Myrtle Avenue, which is home to Pratt Institute and is a street filled with every restaurant or business you could dream of — several bars, a liquor store, barber, bubble tea, antique store, a florist, etc. I would describe it as a young neighborhood, with lots of college students and young professionals, and placed right on the border of Bed-Stuy, a huge plus. To be honest, I miss the area so much that I’m looking into moving back into the neighborhood. 

The building is cavernous, but easy to navigate. The most unfortunate thing about it is the laundry area, which is in the basement and only reachable by what can only be referred to as a tunnel. The units themselves are unique and lofty. During the summer, an air conditioner is definitely needed unless you don’t plan on wearing clothing while home, at all. The live-in supers are great and any maintenance was a breeze, since they lived a few doors or floors down. Overall, I would love to live here again, but due to COVID, I just couldn’t afford the rent.

Don't live here in this house, because before you settle there, they're going to try to squeeze money from you. My analysis represents my poor rental office experience. After seeing an apt that was very small and costly, I filled out an online application, but I had to transfer to get in on July 1st, and this was the only available apt in the house. I got a really good feeling while speaking to the rental agent in the house. The officer was very kind and polite and vowed to accept my request within a few hours. I was paid with 2 forms of payments when I filled out the online application (do not make my mistake) on June 30th. $125 as an application fee and an online payment of $600 to be paid against the rent. I called the rental office and the agent explained to me that if I register at the office, I won't have to pay the $600, but there is a fee and it is online, but I don't have to think about it being refundable because, in the worst scenario, it's refundable. I can get reimbursed if I do not sign a contract. It sounds OK and rational, and I was unable to get to their downtown office that day anyway. Within a few hours or a day, I did not hear anything from them and could not expect any comment about my acceptance. On Monday, July 1st, I received a message that I got accepted and should come in and sign the lease and transfer on the same day after I had already found another apt to move into that day. I'm letting the leasing office know it's too late, because I'm not getting the apartment. In the beginning, the rental agent who was so nice raised her voice and told me that I would not get back the $725 I paid, which included a ""refundable"" deposit of $600 as she said before. Her stance was completely different and turned out to be really abusive. It did not help when I reminded her that in the beginning she presented various policies and that a deposit is not a charge and can be refunded if for some reason a contract would not go through. Other than that, nothing claimed on their webpage that there was a $725 charge in the case of application cancellation. A few minutes later, my website account was deleted, the apartment was back on the market and then it was leased. It is noticed that my transaction with this firm is even seen. My deposit was never returned to them. This is not an honest activity and it is obvious that it is a trap to charge $725 without any notice and consider taking anything without giving something in return. I'll have to sue them in order to get my money back, which I will certainly do. BE WARRY! They aren't blunt!",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,,,4.42,3.06,A,100%,21

Our unit was two floors above them, making their bi-weekly patio parties feel like they take place in our living room. The worst part? Apparently the ground level apartment’s lease is continuously passed on between groups of friends. Meaning that the five 20-something year old guys who lived there during our time in the building would pass it on to a similar group of friends in the near future. Their apartment is literally a party space; they own huge, loud speakers that shake the entire building; drunk, loud people go in and out of the building throughout the day when they throw their parties; and whenever they take their party to their outside patio, which is often, the noise extend to the neighboring buildings too. Are you into frat-style parties that happen every other weekend? This is the building for you. We used to get noise from other neighbors too, but the parties taking place on the ground level floor really dwarf any other case of noise pollution we experienced. 
- The building is dirty. No surprises there, especially since the ground floor is literally a frat house. A cleaning person would come and vacuum the carpeted floor in the hallway occasionally but they wouldn’t stand a chance against the dirt and filth that some of the neighbors leave behind. Inevitably, it often smells bad too.
- The in-building washer and dryer situation is a fraud. They often break and even when they work they do a lousy job. Dryer doesn’t dry clothes. Had to pay using a laundromat often.
- Mice. We found/trapped/killed 8 of them during our lease. We saw some in the dryer-washer basement of the building too. Nuff said here.
- The landlord and super are not really there to help you. Honestly, if they’re willing to let 5 young men rent out a unit in order to have space for loud parties, that says it all about their priorities.
- Heating is not amazing. A few times in the dead of the winter we felt an unbearable draft, forcing us to walk around the apartment wrapped up in blankets. When we asked the super to fix the problem he said that he can’t do much and that we’re feeling the cold because the windows in the unit are big hence not fully isolated. Yep, he actually said that.
- 14th street is not a street to live on. Yes, it’s central and you get access to every subway line, but the centrality of it makes it a hub of noise, dirt and sketchy folks.
- Given all of the above, rates here are not worth it. We enjoyed a nice pandemic deal, but honestly, a person who pays the regular-times rent for units in this building is a fool.",,,,,,2,1,N,Y,N,,,,,3.28,2.93,A,99%,1

The service is OK in the house. In general, the daytime doorman is helpful. Sometimes the others are more interested in chatting to each other (there are usually 2 doormen on duty) than supporting tenants. I pulled up with a trunk full of packages the other day and neither of the two attendants interrupted their conversation to help me unload the vehicle. I was also surprised that after generously tipping each management member last season, the service did not improve - I gave almost $1,000 in tips and did not get as much as a thank you from one management member. There are plenty of laws that are apparently random. For eg, I stopped at the front desk the other day to make a repair request and they insisted that they could not physically log a request in and that it had to be done over the internet - no exceptions. If you are asking them to open your door, too (e.g., If by accident you locked your keys inside), they keep track of it and if it happens more than once a year, there is a fee. Other than this, the house is all right. The apartments are very well renovated (although the closets are smaller than those in similar buildings e.g., Windsor Court). The pool and the deck on the roof are fine, and the gym is okay. You normally have to spend a couple hundred bucks for the gym, but they've recently added it free of charge (probably temporary). The building hallways are okay, but they haven't been updated since the 90's. Bear in mind that 29th street has a fire department, so this building is loud. Do not take a south or east facing device if you are a light sleeper. The zone, while young, is healthy. If you are out of school for 1-4 years and want to see your old classmates out at the local pubs, then you're going to enjoy it. In that age group, most individuals in the building are While some small families and older professionals undoubtedly remain. The train is just a couple of blocks away. Because of the proximity to the taxi break area at 28th and Lexington, it is also unusually convenient for taxis.

This new leases are to drive long-term tenants out and shuffle in the new wealthier occupant who can afford the high rents and will pay them. One point recently heard from a chat with the new super, who was just over a year in the building at the time of this note, is that mgmt does not want a permanent long-term lease, but rather one that allows a seasonal turnover: short stays, causing more inflated and higher rentals to be legally permitted. Mgmt has dissolved all sense of neighborhood or place that the building used to own because of throwing out the old and cramming in the new. In the elevator and hallways, it is a nice 50/50 friendliness. The building history is also eliminated due to this involuntary transfer and the new occupant is not available to be aware of the location where they are living. In our living setting, place, community, history are critical and 95 Christopher's mgmt has dissolved every measure of area, neighborhood, and both the building and the West Village history. Shame, too. Shame! The house is a superb West Village building with stunning views. Perfectly situated and central to a variety of metro lines and decent diners. 95 Christpher is an old building with several problems: countless leaks of water; windows that not only bead up with moisture but encourage cold or hot air to flow in when closed; walls rendered thinner during repairs, causing simple eavesdropping or your next door neighbour, downstairs and up, and their everyday routines and sexual activities; elevators always out of service (always verify that the car is there before the door opens!); water is shut off often year round; plenty of smokers and dogs in building (one doorman claimed that there are more dogs than people in building), so if you have problems with any case you might want to reconsider; and many more that can be mentioned. In general, the doorman is an okay batch of guys, but be wary of what you're saying and who's news for mgmt. By the way, on weekday nights and all weekend long, the noise level can be extreme. All the noise appears to be amplified as it rises up the house, not only with street traffic and human activity, but you will also have to deal with the noise produced by rooftop A/C and exhaust fans from nearby diners.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,5+ years,,3.94,2.93,A,100%,10

There is definitely no sound proofing and too many gaps and crevices for second hand smoke due to the age of the house to fill your apt. I'm a non-smoker, because it's virtually difficult for neighbours who fail to open a window while smoking to cover clothes and bedrooms with smoke or other toxic odors. The mgmt is all right, but it requires the leadership of highly trained repairers. Before any big work is required, the repair work you need can get worse or only be temporarily repaired. Good explanations are simple, temporary, and messy. For hot water, the water pressure is strong, but the cold is bad for some reason, so you have to have weak showers so that you do not burn yourself. The building is in the process of undergoing cosmetic modifications as well as fire doors being added, But I think it's just being done to apply MCI fees to current rentals to drive the lower tenants out. The younger tenants are usually rich and unfriendly by and wide. I have encountered several new occupants trying to shut the doors of the elevator to discourage individuals from entering them in the elevator. I have stayed for many years (when it was a bad area) in this house, but mainly I stay because it is now my only ""home"" and the location has become safer and more convenient.

Some of the cons - Again, not one of the newer buildings, so all the trimmings are not brand spanking new (I think it was built in 2004).

Menus in the vestibule. Yes, all delivery people believe it is their duty, for no reason, to leave endless menus. Many individuals no longer even order from menus. For more than 1 or 2 days at best, they are always tidied up and typically never there. Many of the diners were called to beg them not to abandon them on numerous occasions. 2. Boiler: It has broken down twice in three years of operations. In both cases, on one weekend, the boiler was fixed in 4-5 hours. 3. ""Cheap"" fabrics. It's a mid-range house here. This is NOT a house for luxury. People who comment imply that this is a luxurious house. The cabinets are personalized and certainly not ""cheap"" The floors are 3"" oak of high quality, and the countertops are 1.5"" solid granite thick. The floors of the bathroom and kitchen are a middle of the road slate tile, the fixtures are all mid-range. Maybe ""White appliances"" are alluded to by people.They may, perhaps, state that they would prefer stainless steel. That would be a fruitful remark. 4. Noise: Yeah, some people in the building complain they cannot hear anybody at all. In both the kitchen and the toilet, the ventilation system exists. Noise is capable of going into the vents, but it is not uncommon. It is more common to provide a soundproof ventilation system in a luxurious home. By adding vent covers, pleased tenants rectify this. 5. Spills and Trash in the Hallways: This can happen from time to time, but definitely not at all on a daily basis. This is a mid-range apartment building with 39 apartments. There is no budget for a doorman or a full time attendant in a building of this scale. The doorman and full-time attendants are available in unit sizes of 65 units or more. So maybe someone spills something occasionally and it takes until the next morning to get washed up. This is not at all an enormous or popular concern. 6. Washers:Washers: Yeah, they do break down computers. One of the computers has been patched, and often it could not have been fixed directly as they needed maintenance, but Definitely not months of being down as one commenter suggested. Three washers and three dryers are available, but there has never been a moment when it was difficult to really do laundry. 7. Arijuana smoking: there were people who were smoking and a legal warning letter was submitted in full. Burning of weeds is not tolerated. The complaining commenter may have called the police, but that person appears to want to hide behind an anonymous posting. Weed smoking is not always yet was ALWAYS debated as it did. 8. Roofdeck: The roofdeck is not open, said one commenter. That's absolutely untrue. It is available at all times. Someone wanted to smoke once, and they were rebuked at first. 9. The Kids on the Block: It's normal in NYC for kids to hang out in front of their houses. This commentator was talking to a group of next door adolescents gathered on their stoop. Never once did one of those children say something disrespectful or do something that made me doubt their behavior. They did help me with heavy lifting, honestly. I've seen kids who are bad news who hang on the corner, shout profanities and are up to no good despite living in NYC for almost 2 decades. These children are simply beyond passing time, and you can easily understand the distinction if you know NYC. In Harlem particularly. This is a quiet block, as opposed to many other blocks in Harlem. About that, there is absolutely no doubt. The individual who said this is a loud block must equate it with Westchester or New Jersey, where blocks are much quieter. Much of the key things, I guess I addressed them. Since this forum allows anonymous posts, for individuals looking to vent, it sounds almost like a scratching post. I am confident we would have constructive feedback rather than RANTS if individuals used their initials. We have 39 units and 5 move-outs since the beginning (3 years of operations). One person did not renew his work permit, one person relocated to the midwest because of lack of job fulfillment, one person moved to the upper east side, but suggested her friend the building, one person decided to live in midtown because she felt separated from her East Harlem social life. There is ONE other person that I think wrote ALL of the remarks. Every entity has a viewpoint, and nothing is ever flawless, but the tone of the comments switches me off. There are lots of really good stuff happening in this house. No one takes the time to write comments here to share the numerous times someone has come to open the doors of locked-out tenants at unusual hours. Many individuals have shared how much they appreciate staying here and how much they would like to buy if it were to be turned into a condo. Most people love their neighbours and joke about how they will never hear anybody. I'm not saying anything is fine, but it seems like all the pessimistic critics are searching for a professionally serviced house for a doorman/elevator. This is a small, simple building with elevators with good interiors and maintained accordingly. Depending on the scale, position and service quality, the same lodging in a doorman elevator building would cost $500-$700 more annually.

Make sure to have a refurbished one with parquet floors. Pets are accepted. I've never had a problem with a bug, so I can't comment. Relatively inexpensive for a midtown doorman's building. Not that good: the lifts sucked. In an 18-floor flat, at least one was always broken, often 2, not good. Kitchens are non-existent and a lot of fires were sparked by the setup, at least three when I lived there. Even, with no sprinklers or PA, if the trucks were outside, the only way you heard about a fire was. This was once a home for musicians and a residential hotel, but cooking was not a priority. As people say, the upstairs floors and halls were sort of dingy. Some have been renovated, but not mine. The rent hikes were insane when I was here. In four years, my rent went up almost 30 percent, so now it looks like they are getting what they deserve. In the world, mgmt wasn't the friendliest.

And when I asked the leasing office about the sub-letting process, they offered the possibility of transferring my lease to a new occupant, while failing to note that the expense of an assignment (versus a sub-let, which would be $0) was me covering their costs of retrofitting the apartment and renting a week for the time it would take them. And they forgot to note this information until more than a month after giving me the runaround (and too late for me to find a subletter), I was told of this $1600 ""assignment fee"" before the assignment papers were provided—which was the FIRST TIME. And note, due to this dishonest lack of disclosure of the assignment fee, I had turned down a few sublet deals at my lower current rent (for $0 fee).

We can't tell you enough about the doorman who makes us feel comfortable here, day or night, either.

You may kiss peace and quiet goodbye if you are among the many whose windows face this place. At unreasonable hours, trucks come and go, and a front loader they use lets off a piercing warning-beep as it backs up. It's like working on top of a construction site. Two, the second floor within the apt building also occupies B&H. I don't know what kind of business they're doing there, but every once and a while, the lower floors of the building are overcome with a noxious odor similar to that of burning rubber. I asked the doorman what it was the first time I smelled it. He said ""B&H is doing something."" On a different day, I got the same response from a different doorman. There are the constant annoyances of Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, the Farley Post Office, and the Lincoln Tunnel, practically in your back yard, aside from the constant irritation of B&H. If you love excessive noise and aggressive crowds, then you'll love it here. To serve some sort of domestic lifestyle, there are few diners and shops nearby, and the appearance of homeless people in the neighborhood can be depressing.

There was no detail on demands for repairs. There was no details on a strategy for painting. There was no details on concierge equipment. There wasn't even any details on signing up online to pay rent. Let me send you another example with all of this in mind. I received a very large box (about 80lbs) broken a few days after moving in. It was just about the size of one square foot, but it was really large. Obviously, I had a lot of trouble pushing it and took it to the first elevator I could get into, with a lot of effort. Now, bear in mind, this kit just took up an area of one square foot since it was on the end of it. I get an email later that day that is a ""reminder"" that parcels should be delivered to the freight elevator because they can cause delays. Explain how I was meant to know that, please. Or how I was going to get the box to the elevator for freight. If you want to consider yourself a ""luxury"" house, you should drop packages at the door of the tenants, especially if they're so big. This has been achieved by every other building I have lived in in the area. ""the lounge is closed""the lounge is closed. Not only aren't the hours posted anywhere, but I was obviously on the way out. When you want the lounge to be closed, the final hours should be in the lounge. For laws that do not apply, I don't like being reprimanded. Since I was here, I had to make two repair demands and both resulted in a tragedy. The first period was when I had burnt out the light outside my bedroom. He repaired the light on the day I made the order. Great, I thought. The same repair man comes barging in my apartment, turning lights on and off, except at precisely 9:01am the next morning when I'm still sleeping. I asked him what he was doing, and he said he was searching for an outdoor lamp. I advised him that the light had already been replaced, and that it was outside my bedroom. He swiftly left. The second period was when I had lost the gasket on my bathtub drain. I didn't want a replay of what happened last time, so for the 1-5pm time slot I labelled ""By Appointment Only"" But, of course, there's a repair worker moving in at 9:04am. We have walls, thank Goodness, because if this were a studio and he barged in whilst I was sleeping, all the hell would have broken loose. I'm not sure what else to do four hours after I go to bed to avoid getting woken up. I'm not going to sleep until 4pm, and I've been working all night. Any time something goes wrong, I can't afford to be woken up at 9am. Today, one of the lights in my bathroom went out, so I think we'll see how that goes. Overall, with the huge amount of money I'm spending, I'm incredibly dissatisfied with bad service. About 95 Wall, there are plenty of other suites. Don't make the same mistake that I made.

Almost everyone can come in without being asked and walk out of the house. This isn't normally a huge deal, except that we're in the middle of Times Square and you're wandering around with lots of shady characters. My worst fear in the hallways was running into a robber or a rapist or a homeless person. The least they should do is be a little more strict on tourists and new faces wandering straight by security with the high rents they charge. With children and a home, I could never imagine feeling secure in that house. 2- When I moved in, they used the wrong paint in the shower, resulting in extreme green mold and water stains all over the bathroom. Finally, after a month of going back and forth, they repainted the bathroom with enough paint to fix the problem. They declined to pay me for the discomfort of using a moldy bathroom for a month and the possible health risks. When they knew it was their mistake for choosing the wrong colour, they didn't even apologise. 3- The next door is used as a business office with four screen computers and office staff, peeking from my kitchen window and balcony, coming in and out every day. You really shouldn't be able to operate a business in a luxurious residential building with 4 full time workers. I warned mgmt and they didn't care that four men from this apartment didn't live there, and these men were watching my wife take their smoke breaks through the kitchen glass. It didn't give mgmt two hoots about it. It's shameful and frightening that Stonehenge will encourage this kind of conduct to happen. The lease of this apt has also been extended, effectively condoning this behaviour. 4- In combination with Marriott, the building is used as a restaurant, meaning you appear to get loud, thoughtless and often intoxicated guests in the lobby and elevator. Why is it that they use a luxurious apartment complex as a hotel? 5- The lounge for tenants is still dirty. Said Enough. 6- Super unfriendly is the lease extension process. It's all about business, and Stonehenge is all about currency. 7- Since the building did not have the freight elevators available on the days I needed, I had to shuffle my calendar around. On the day and time I ended up booking the elevator, during my transfer, I was promised the elevator to myself for a couple of hours. As the freight elevator was triple booked, the transfer took triple the time I expected for. What is the point of giving me such a hard time not giving me my pick of moving-out dates just to triple book the elevator at the time I booked, costing me hundreds of extra dollars in overtime mover fees. 8- When going between floors, I had trouble with 2 of the 4 elevators shaking violently. My wife got trapped in the same elevator once. I did some analysis online and since April 2013, these elevators have had active unresolved breaches, as per the New York City Department of Buildings website. I typically feel secure in elevators, but given that these elevators have ongoing unsolved security breaches, and considering my next point #9, I think these elevators need to be patched as soon as possible before anyone gets trapped in them again. 9- I inferred that Stonehenge is an uncaring, money-hungry enterprise that is unfit to be the owner of a high-rise luxury building, let alone any building. Don't take my word for it, though. Read this story about the ad exec falling to her death because of a serious flaw in another building in Midtown Stonehenge http://hollywoodlife.com/2013/08/03/jennifer-rosoff-balcony and make your own decision whether you ever felt comfortable staying in a building in Stonehenge. Like the flu, I'd stop Ritz Plaza. Hang as far away as you possibly can from Ritz Plaza and Stonehenge. The worst decision you will ever make is to move to The Ritz Plaza.

A fire truck will come barreling out of this station many times per day with sirens wailing at full blast. There are no double-paned windows in Ritz Plaza, so you're going to hear this siren loud and clear. You'll be able to hear very little more whether you're on the South or West Side. The thin windows have another downside. The apartment will always be too hot in the summer, and in the winter it will always be too cold. If the temperature in the corridor is too high, mgmt will not let you turn on the heat during late fall / early winter, or late winter / early spring. The temperature in your bedroom, on the outside of the house, would be much cooler, of course. Be prepared for a very big energy bill in the summer if you plan to live here and choose to be happy. The hallways sometimes stink of cigarettes, too. Not on - floor, but on most floors. Yet there are highly sensitive smoke alarms. If you do cook food in the apt, the smoke alarm in your apt would be set off. And the internal doors appear to warp and get trapped (bedroom, bathroom). Actually, you will get lost. The management is decent, and if you don't look too close, the building looks good, but there are a lot of secret flaws, so beware of tenants.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,Currently Living,,,4.43,5.75,A,99%,15

I think that says a lot but  the filthy climb to to the top lined with cigarette stubs, dead roaches, and other miscellaneous garbage is only the beginning of the horrors. Appears previous tenants were running some kind of fight club? Every inch of every wall is uneven and sloppily patched up. Some holes were covered with tape and painted over! Black mold in between bathroom tiles covered up with a crumbling new layer of caulk. Paint jobs are careless throughout. all fixtures are old and outdated. There’s is cigarette residue coming through vent causing a mysterious sticky orange substance to coat the walls even after wiping it away. Many more minor issues I had fixed with my persistence that management is not too keen on. No heat for first months of winter, had to fight to get radiators repaired! On top of all is a shady super who gets mad when he has to attend to super responsibilities and picks through the trash. When being shown the apartment the first time, I asked him if there was somewhere I could keep my bike. “Yes” he said “Follow me”. He led me to the front door of the lobby, stick his head out, and pointed to a public bike rack down the block. “You can lock your bike there” he said sarcastically. I should have ran for the hills. MightI mention that this was the emergency relocation unit offered to me after the doorman in my last building sexually harassed and stalked me. He broke into my apartment on numerous occasions and stole my underwear which was finally revealed after an entry gone awry. I begged for months to get out there as they ignored my pleas. Finally, I was moved from my brand new cherished studio to this crusty one bedroom that I am pretty sure is slowly killing me. Be careful what you ask for I guess.. The one thing I can day is that legs and glutes are in tip top shape after dealing with these stairs. Always a bright side!

The neighbors are nice and everyone, including the concierge desk, are friendly - some good people who still have a smile on them! Some of my friends and relatives lived in similar homes and I heard my fair share of horror stories! I'm proud to say that I would highly recommend this building to anyone in Midtown Manhattan looking to rent a luxury home.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,4.87,4.67,A,99%,6

Here, I completely love it. It makes the building pretty all the time. The doorman is brilliant and knows everyone by their first name. In maintenance, the management constantly goes beyond and above outstanding. Usually, if you need to fix a lightbulb, they'll come there on the next day and give you a message saying what they did and calling them for any questions. The fitness center is small, but decent and rarely overcrowded. The common room is cramped, but if appropriate, it offers a nice place to chill and have a meeting. The roof deck is EXCELLENT. It's a nice location for a cocktail or for dinner - a dream date spot - nice 360 views of Manhattan. Finally, in every bedroom, there is a washer/dryer!! EXPENSIVE! CONS: There's no denying that the Post is proud of building them. The rents here are utterly rediculous - $3800-$4250 a month for 1 bed/1 bath rent for north. Every lease period usually raises rentals by 10 percent. Unfortunately, because I can no longer afford to live here, I have to relocate because, even in this terrible economy, they are unable to assist with the cost of housing.

View: The view out of the window is on the inside of the building, so mostly brick/concrete, but it is far from being a view of the air shaft—there is a wide outside space since it looks out over a large low roof (far below). Light: facing east, with good morning sunshine. The window is at an angle of 90 degrees to the windows of the building's other apts, so light from those apts often falls in at night. Plus, unlike the rooms in Hayden, the smoke detector is in the kitchen (with blue light accompanying it), and so the bedrooms do not light up. Facilities: The closet is actually very spacious, with shelves and room for the hangar. On the wall above the desk, three more long shelves mean there's plenty of storage space for books and other small items. Both the bathroom and kitchen are serviceable, although some of the plumbing is old and sophisticated. When I moved in, the HVAC unit on the wall was really dirty, because maintenance had skipped the previous tidying period. However, maintenance is very sensitive to maintenance requests, and even non-urgent requests are typically corrected within the day. For the entire house, there is only one laundry room; Hayden is certainly better for secure laundry access. The best part, clearly, is that it is a three-minute walk to class.

Mgmt is the worst thing I've ever witnessed. I signed my intention to leave more than 60 days before leaving as necessary. I'm classified as a covenant with my roommate. Two weeks before our date of departure, she agreed to stay and move in with a new roommate. Mgmt took this as an excuse to completely cancel our notice of intent to leave without even notifying me. It wasn't until I raised the heck that they ever called to my notice that I would be held a month-to-month lease after my initial lease had expired, unless I had signed my existing lease to her new roommate.

I spent just over a year (2009-2010) at Hudson Yards (455W37) and I would strongly recommend it. The doorman/concierge in this building is superb (Rod, Pete, Jose). They were all very friendly, easily knew names, able to assist with deliveries, etc. They got to know the people. The porters and repairmen are often fine, and respond quickly to requests for repairs. Within the hour, the few I sent were replied to. The valet management is also very strong, and the turnover of the operation is very rapid. The grounds are all very well kept (building, outside, corridors, elevators etc). The lobby is spotless, the open areas are still washed, and the corridors are constantly swept. This is a brand new house, and it looked like it all the time. Our apartment (a terraced unit on the lower floor) was huge and well finished. Brand fresh, and high design, were all the appliances. The reason we decided to leave after a year does not apply to the construction or management, but rather to the venue. There were some false claims about how easily retail would open up at the base of the building. The deli officially opened after 13 months. It is possible that the neighborhood will be nice one day, but it is also up and coming and gritty/dirty. I didn't feel dangerous, but the walk home was never fun (especially at night).

I've lived in many downtown buildings and this has been the toughest experience I've had by far. Seriously, I would not suggest this house. This architecture agency, UDR, attempted to escape before it had crawled. Don't be misled by the opulent lobby. Most simple needs are non-existent in this house. First of all, it will take up to a half hour for the water to turn hot in the nights, and even during out the day. Second, the lifts are constantly sluggish, and they break. Third, the windows are leaky and defective in the house. Not only do the windows leak air (heavy drafts that make the winter cold and the summer hard to cool), they even leak moisture. Water will seep through the caulking on our windows as it rains heavily, and ruin any products we have on the window sills/floor. The windows will burst open when it is windy, opening our whole property to the rain in the storm. And if we're not home during a hurricane, we're more likely to be vulnerable for the remainder of the storm. On top of that, package mgmt is abominable. They lost upwards of 5 of the packages and products of my apt's laundry operation, some permanently lost. June, the woman who runs the package room, is arrogant and has an inability to fix problems (ie think in outside of the box to ensure that her most basic responsibility, getting people their packages, is achieved). June still has a comprehension difference, with a dense international accent, but she is more likely to give up on them instead of attempting to hear what people are doing. Never have I experienced worse customer service. Although I have informed the mgmt building of this, they do nothing to rectify it (or guarantee the inhabitants of their building have access to their property at a minute). At best, the ""luxury"" they offer is suspicious, the doorman hardly does an adequate job inspecting guests, the exercise machines are continually disabled, and every handyman service is often backlogged. In comparison, the building's mgmt is bad, explicitly Tara. She can't fix a puzzle in order to save her soul. She has no supervision over the administration of her (clearly, given the misgivings of June and the utter failure of the doorman to do their job). She is therefore utterly unable to consider the tenant's hand, her victim, and is completely unable to empathize. It's a mystery to me that she wasn't fired, because she is obviously a loser. The window condition is supremely unacceptable, in my mind. Several times, they visited my flat, moved stuff about, left things dusty, and were unable to fix the problem.This sounds like something that should be reimbursed by mgmt or allowed to cancel the contract, but no. They're too far from customer-oriented, they couldn't reckless with their tenants, and they're not afraid to lose you, with the supply of people seeking accommodation in Manhattan, resulting in your failure. They're trying to scam you too. They have you pay rent using their web platform (you can pay search, but they discourage this greatly) and if the server is down—on it's you (which it has been for me for the last 3 mos). If you raise it to them, before it is past due time, they will not respond conveniently and not even entertain that their method is the source of the cause. You're going to get slapped with a $250 late fee—and again when all they care about is making a buck off you, battling for revenge and good luck. If you have declined to pay, you will only continue to raise the fee. The only thing I can say that mgmt has done well is deter pests— I didn't see any glitches or rodents in the department, so that's the bar I'm keeping right now for them. Don't be fooled by the jazzy entrance and the sophisticated shell—this place is nothing more than a Manhattan renters' factory, and all they're going to do with you is take your money with them.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,Currently Living,,,4.42,3.06,A,100%,21

If you don't trust the negative feedback here, or you're making the same mistake I made. Below are some of the terrible problems that I faced during my time living there. 1. When I first moved in, the wall was paper thin and the machine was filthy. A friend next to my apartment held a lot of celebrations. On Saturday night, at 11pm, I had to call the front desk. They sent someone to convince them why the number was bigger, and the neighbor declined to do so. As a result, they started drinking in the middle of the night, and the front desk just said they could do little. So I had 311 to dial. I had to dial 311 2 to 3 times during my time there because people who are expected to treat problems like this are basically useless. The interior of the apartments is antique and filthy. It seems like they're never clean. The refrigerator was leaking and the AC was not running!!! 2. It was very difficult to work with leasing and mgmt. I could see plainly he completely forgot I was coming and anyway, mgmt was closed on Sunday. The mgmt and the front desk gave me the hardest time when I called the city gov to arrange a major furniture pickup when I was moving out. BUT, even though I was doing a proper disposal, the mgmt was pressuring me to charge me money. I was so upset that I called mgmt and asked what it even said. She said the city would still fine the building even though I disposed of the furniture properly. And I told her I made a city pick-up appointment, then she stopped for a second and said, well, that's good in that situation. She also thought that I wasn't calling the city and she didn't even bother to say that if I didn't find out for myself, there was a choice like that. Amazingly supportive! 3. In order to keep the security deposit, they try everything (I didnt get a penny back). So it came down to my last choice. To get out of the lease, I had to pay more. Once again, if they find someone on March 31, I called for a lease and they said no. So I charged one more month on April 2nd and they kept the security deposit. BUT guess what, I just got a streeteasy email that the unit was rented on April 5th. It was just three days after I paid the penalty and someone was found. It could be sheer chance or Fraud is the whole thing. The judge, you should be. For me, it was actually a bad experience, period.

Four years ago, I moved in and I feel the building works pretty good. Super Frank was very supportive when I first moved in at night on the weekend. Because of my work and moving schedule at the end of the month, I did not move in on weekdays. My last building only tolerated moving-in between 9am and 3pm on weekdays. It was okay with Super Frank. He also introduced A/C and added a new lock (tip/minimum fee) as well. The laundry room is still available, which is nice for my insane schedule, and there's a bike room in the house. The super is still there (putting up blinds, signing/taking packages, moving/fixing furniture, etc.) anytime I inquire or need something to be fixed in my apt. I once had to deal with water from an upstairs occupant from damage to my kitchen and bathroom roofs field. Super Frank came to report on the issue and the mgmt credited me for the inconvenience before fixing the problem the following month. The region that is close to the building is fine. There are 6 colleges (Columbia, Barnard, Manhattan School of Music, Bank Street Church, Jewish & Union Theological Seminary), 3 parks (Central, Riverside & Morningside Park) (dog parks, tennis/basketball courts, baseball/football fields), 2 trains (1/B/C), west side highway, several diners, restaurants, post offices, malls, etc. In this huge, insane place, it feels like an environment. It is also useful to get around the city to discover areas with 2 train lines, end of block zipcar rentals, nearby west side highway and M60 bus to the airport at the corner (also buses on each avenue and crosstown to eastside).

Any other building in the area (180 water, 200 water, 45 and 63 wall sts) allowed its inhabitants to use their protection, no questions asked, no pressure applied.

No one I know has ever had a good encounter with the MGMT in the house. During the recession, they hiked everyone's rent, had absurd rules in the house, and tried to kick people out at any turn. They recently began to come up with random ""loopholes"" in order to oust tenants so that new (and potentially better paying) tenants could be brought in. In reality, a close friend was evicted because this summer she was on rent a few days late and then did not know that the mgmt firm ""stopped accepting"" her checks (she kept sending them, so they didn't just cash them). This is evidently a well established method of ""turnover"" typical to the city's shady mgmt companies. This is not a pet friendly house, considering what they advertise, and all my friends with dogs have had trouble with mgmt about them. They are also selective about who they approach - a neighbor with a dog is continuously sending threatening letters over his dog barking, but after repeated calls from the floor, another neighbor who holds parties every night and smokes in the hall has not even been talked to. My only guess for a reason is that for 4 years the neighbor with the dog has been there and spends less than this current neighbor, so the mgmt will rather get the dog out and a new high-paying renter in. That said, all the doormen are awesome, as are the service personnel. The services are fine, but the price you pay is surely not worth it (the gym is a dungeon with a sad display of equipment and the laundry room is filled with flies).",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,5+ years,,4.74,5.20,A,98%,12

It makes me feel like a nice condition has been soiled, though my experience with Riverwatch has been great for 2.5 years. HOWEVER We've experienced a Fair number of ROACHES in the last few months. ALL Around the apartment. They began in the kitchen area, predominantly. We lodged requests for assistance with the house. They came and didn't do anything. They rubbed some gel on our fridge's side. We believed they stayed UNDER/BEHIND the fridge & stove, so we pushed the OURSELVES appliances and uncovered Hundreds of LIVE roaches. We raided them, killed them, and watched as more and more came through the holes in the walls behind the equipment that the piping had made. ""We even found one IN THE DISHWASHER AFTER IT WAS RUN. They came to put ""TRAPS"" down in the toilets because we told the building this and that they wanted to do something else. To this day, in the past 3 months, ONE single roach has been trapped in those traps. Know the reality of how they're going to work if your apt has a case like this. ** I can remember that if the building cooperates in recognizing our situation and correctly addresses the problem we have in understanding that the room has become UNLIVABLE and ensuring that our rent for August is paid, considering the living conditions and the inappropriate treatment of this question, I Would change this review to make it a 5* review that truly represents the experience I had for the first 2 Yeah, thank you.** I Dislike ROACHES Completely BECAUSE THEY ARE Filthy AND UP TO THIS POINT THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN IN MY ROOM ASIDE Sometimes, AND I LET IT SLIDE, BUT THE SIGHT OF THIS SWARM OF ROACHES* IN MY BEDROOM* WAS SO Gross I FELT Compelled TO LEAVE.

For the money, the apts seem tiny, but my roommate and I are very pleased with our flex 2 bed unit. Our kitchen is big enough to hold 2 people cooking at the same time, our bathroom is massive and IN our unit, which was huge for us, we have a washer/dryer. However, the outdoor communal areas completely snatch the spotlight. A gorgeous roof deck with lots of new patio furniture is open (lounge chairs, tables, etc). There is nothing better on a summer night than seeing the sun fall with a bottle of wine. The second floor also has a really nice patio area for outdoor dinners with ample seating. I sometimes use the little gym on the second floor as well. It's only six aerobic machines (two treadmills), so it's hardly busy and a nice size. The management has been polite and supportive at all times. In 48 hours, all the maintenance problems I have ever had were fixed (emergencies attended to immediately). My only criticism is that your apt does not leave any kind of warning in the super/maintenance management. Well, as they were inside to patch stuff. Once, without notifying me or my roommate, they removed my whole fridge. When we learned the food had been rearranged, the only way we figured out was. If they sent an email or left a little message, it would be nice if most buildings did. Overall, Post Luminaria is really happy!

On weekends, avoid the crowds of Manhattan, if you want to have a little quiet in your life. Awesome yoga studios - check out the yoga project in Tangerine and Brooklyn. Great for pets and young families. YMCA (with a full 25 yard pool), all within walking distance of Equinox, Blink, NYSC. Brooklyn Bridge Park is a 10-minute walk away - a perfect location for running and taking in the best views of the Brooklyn Bridge and Downtown Manhattan. Centrally placed Trader Joes - if you don't want to spend a 50 percent premium on your groceries. Appropriate rents are much higher than anywhere else in Manhattan. The food is great - check out Smith Lane, Court Street and Montague Street. If you're lucky, maybe you'll just see the beloved Kyle Cunningham of NYU taking a walk! Cons: In Brooklyn Heights/Cobble Hill/Boerum Hill, few single individuals live. You probably won't find one here if you're looking for a partner (everybody's taken away).

During a recent fire (after 4 apts burnt to the ground when some brain surgeon left their front door open to let the fire spread), residents were terrified that they might have no way out of the building because most days elevators are not working (for a building of more than 30 floors) and some prick(s) took it upon themselves to cut doorknobs on doors leading to the stairway.

I work from home and could invest some of my time to street parking. For those who want to save about 5 K/year on a parking, street parking in BPC is possible. When we moved in I was paying for Battery Parking Garage (cheapest in the area, if I'm not mistaken), located across West Side Highway. But then I tried street parking and realized that it is easier than I always thought. 2. You can take a free shuttle to get to Whole Foods in Tribeca or South Street Seaport.

Six years ago, I had an unexpected hit to my credit history—I had a flawless payment history before and since then I have a perfect payment history—and they will also not authorize me to rent without having any of what I listed above, and my combined household income is over $200,000. I live in NY already and have a high rent, so there should not have been a problem with the monthly number. I've also been in the same building for three years and have never been late on a bill, but that's meaningless, I suppose. I asked if I would have to use them again if I extended my contract, as Insurent is around 90 percent of a month's rent.

Switch to 1080 Amsterdam, which is just across the street, if you want to move into a luxurious building. 1. The day we moved in (as the first tenants who ever lived in the building in the summer of 2017), the roof leaked on our heads and began getting into our unit's walls. The problem was only solved after a week after many constructions within the unit and individuals continuously going in and out and they did not send us another unit. In addition, the washing machines that were meant to be new began to spill on the ground and did not work, and they had to get us fresh ones. On top of this, there was no closure of one of the bedroom doors, and they had to rush back to patch it. And though we were thinking we were going into a new unit, For 2 weeks, we had building personnel in and out of our apt, and the administration did not work with us in the process to relieve our anger. 2. Wilce, the construction boss, is the rudest guy I have ever met in New York, and a liar who has refused email exchanges to my face. He accused us of smoking and had letters sent to our guarantors by his attorneys. We called a construction worker into our apt after getting the letter to ensure that the stink did not come from our unit (while the hallway stinked with smoke), and yet he also declined to send another letter refuting the legal claims he had already submitted. In addition, when I saw him inside the building and asked for a letter, he declined to agree to submit one, even though he said he would do so in writing via email (which I later forwarded him via email and there was no reply). 3. They are very stringent about the timing of the rent paid, but when we moved out after the legitimate 60 day time period they have, they did not agree with paying the security deposit back to us. On top of that, only one of the roommates deducted charges for a drilled cabinet, because the other did not pay their share of last month's rent (although to avoid such issues they do require guarantors from both sides when signing the lease). In addition, the building manager Oksana (which you can see concerns about repeatedly listening to personal calls in the office below instead of talking to the tenants there) asks for payment confirmations every month and if not received, a late fee is paid (although her only job is to administer the checks Brodsky mgmt receives for Enclave). 4. The house claims to be a ""luxury building"" with a doorman and 24/7 management, which is why many individuals chose to live in this building. Around 12 to 6 in the morning, the short and chubby doorman who is responsible for night shifts practically sleeps, refusing to open the door. Instead of using your key fob (which allows you keys to facilities such as the gym and backyard), if you dare to knock rather than use your key fob, he yells at you in the middle of the night, promising not to open it again if you miss your fob, even though it is his only goddamn task. 5. DON'T Buy THE Trick THAT YOU CAN USE ALL Services Anytime YOU WANT. First of all, from 10 am to 10 pm, the backyard is just available and you can't take your dog out there. You need to alert them at least 48 hours in advance in order to use the grills outside or reserve the common space that opens up to the backyard. So if you wake up and it's a nice day and you plan to invite some friends over for dinner in the backyard and barbecue, even if they're bare and just standing there, YOU Should NOT For roof entry, don't be fooled, you don't have access to the roof if you are in a unit on the other side of the hallway. You have to go to the very other side of the house to go up, and any time they check in, you have to come down to sign in with a friend if you don't tell them you're going to have visitors more than 48 hours in advance. 6. The mgmt team was painfully disrespectful in all these challenges we had, constantly rolling their eyes, refusing to speak to us while they were in the office when it was their operating hours, Wilce Robles having the audacity to taunt and yell at his tenants. We found that all the foreign tenants of the building (Wilce Robles and Oksana Marhitych) had this mentality, and that they had guarantors and payers who did not live within the region. As these students (who we were removed from) felt superior, their behaviour was rather condescending and directly inappropriate. I urge you not even attempt to cooperate with Wilce Robles and Oksana Marhitych to someone seeking to rent a building in New York, as they have abused their authority over and over again, refusing to value their tenants who spend too much money to be able to hold a job.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,4.35,5.20,A,97%,4

I called people several times and contacted them. It took them more than a day not to answer the phone. There were lots of people who wanted to visit the Social Security office on the 4th floor as I decided to use the elevator from 10am to 2pm that I reserved.

And I was so angry, but I was handled really poorly by Robert who has been employed for 20 years. When I went to get the carts out, he didn't want me to use the entrance door to get them. So, they were led back to the back door by my mate. It felt okay. But I felt like he was commanding me. So, I told him, "" I knew that you don't have to tell me again"" My English is not that good as you can see. He dismissed me when I tried to explain to him, left me to another direction and laughed wih other coworker I was very angry and asked ""Are you laughing at me"" and he told me ""Yes, I'm laughing at you"" When I heard back from him, I didn't want to be handled like this I kept asking and he told me he was busy and other explanations Eventually, another coworker came and they told me they never metioned metioned.

The day-to-day management is super fine, but the management of the workplace is arrogant and condescending. This season, they've ""upgraded"" the heating system. I have no idea what they have mounted, but the heat no longer works properly. Finally, the main problems are the ""semi legal"" ventilation method of marijuana so that police do not follow regulations. There is a Persistent Heavy odor across the corridor and straight into the apartment as a result. I've tried to cover the necessary door with wet towels as far as practicable, foam tape in some holes, purchased all types of high-end air purifiers — nothing helps.

Of note, mgmt writes its own comments on this here. I was seated with them in the office one day when SHE did so. They are very bitter, presumably because, relative to the other luxury buildings in the city, they have a bad product. And this position is not at all well insulated. I'm now in a stunning modern luxurious house by ARCHSTONE (a really well-liked business in the USA) and I live next to an Arena (like Madison Square Garden) and I don't hear a peep!!! There are regular games and it's so quiet that you wonder if you really are in town!! Unlike those days in the Ivy Tower, I have never slept so well. Every morning, at 7 a.m., children woke up yelling at a playground. The Ivy Tower is way too expensive. On a lovely little website called http://streeteasy.com/New York City/rentals/New York City, I also showed them the expenditures of other comparable buildings nearby as they wanted to increase my rent by 14 percent in one year. (the max permitted by law). This was also after the market lull, where all rentals had fallen. They said there was a regular rate, but on this forum it was so much more than most. The only reason I stayed in the house is that I'm moving a lot and I'm hardly there, luckily. I wish I had first visited this site. When you see something, you wonder how valid it is. But once you see it again, OVER & OVER and OVER, you know that it can't be made up. I wonder who the real insane ones are now, they used to say ppl were crazy. There are also many real luxury buildings around, such as Orion, Silver Towers, etc. As with the lease break, they gave us a lease break, and then they reneged on it, thinking up a lame story as to why we were not allowed to break it. They tried to lie about it, until when she honored the deal in minutes, I questioned the real boss at the mgmt firm. The leasing office was basically trapped in its own deceit, and kept lying till the end! In fact, I was considering finding a lawyer to get out, as I distrusted them too much. Fortunately, the building's Super is a bit more cool minded and he told me that I will get back my maximum deposit, as I kept a really tidy apt. And Indeed, just across from the playground and next door to Holy Cross Elementary, there is a sex offender living in the house. They say that they do background checks. It is difficult to update the status of Category 2 prisoners as to where they live every 90 days if they ever want to say that this is a lie!! I can only see mgmt's lame reaction now saying this isn't real.

The architecture is cool. The leadership is fabulous. When Related sold the house, we were wary of the transition in mgmt, but the new mgmt was excellent - very sensitive to our demands, very easy to deal with, and competent. Senada, the resident service leader of the house, is vigilant and sees it through to completion. She graciously and quickly took care of us anytime we needed her assistance. I can't say enough good things about Zeynep in the leasing office - she's a pleasure to work with, honest, enormously helpful, and knowledgeable. During our time here, we had some oddball demands and Zeynep always found a way to ensure that our specifications were fulfilled. She has a strong attitude to her role in customer service, which is surprisingly unusual in the industry. The desk management, especially Rad, Chris, Emil, and Artie, is awesome. They provide the perfect balance of being there and not being too intrusive whenever you need them. They take good care of our people, our children and our animals, and of our visitors. The maintenance management is similarly strong - they cope promptly and kindly with any complaints, from repairing an air conditioner to removing clogged drains. We use all the facilities of the building and they are nice: the (24-hour and very cheap) gym is updated, well run, and never too busy - it's good to have a pool in the building; the parking is really easy, the management is good there, and there are zipcars available; the roof deck and resident lounge are great for holding parties or just relaxing on our own. The location is nice - next to the central park and steps from the 6 train, practically. I read a review of thin walls of paper, so I would say that your neighbours can't hear you. We sat on two separate floors in two separate fitting lines, both times alongside newborns, and never learned anything. You can get street noise depending on the location of your apartment, but you may be in the wrong city if that is a major concern. I would like the building to be smoke-free. The smoke will also drift up and into your windows from smoking on the lower levels. Not a major deal in winter, but you may need to keep your windows locked on the nice days if you're unlucky enough to live downwind from a smoker. I don't see this as a particular problem for Monterey, because they supplied us with door sweeps, locked our vents, gave us air purifiers, and posted signs on not smoking in common areas in the house. You can't even wish for more. This Can, the laundry room is well kept and has just been renovated. There are plenty of units in the room, so you usually don't have to wait for one. Few apts have in-unit washing, but none of our apts did so, and it was never a challenge to ride the elevator 24 hours a day to do laundry at any time. The building and the administration are fine.

On 34th street and within three blocks is almost every single subway line??? This is a Massive privilege if you're out of town! We were on one of the top floors that I would suggest because the place is loud (outside of the Lincoln Tunnel). Is the rooftop amazing?? There's a picnic table and other seats, because we've always had mates to enjoy the view and the skyline of Manhattan. The best part of all, though, was the doorman. Since hanging out at my other friends' house? I know that it is very unusual to get a successful doorman. In specific, ours (each and every one of them) was awesome. My roommate and I completely LOVED the doorman and I routinely go back to say hi, even though I have moved to a different city now. They're very friendly, culturally diverse, respectful, and very supportive (which I appreciated). They know all of my friends who come by name to visit and make living in Manhattan a warm experience. For my roommate and I, living in a safe doorman/elevator building was crucial and our experience was great. I actually referred several people to the house, and they were all pleased. Concerning safety?? For all hours of the night, 34th Street is occupied, so I never felt insecure. Yeah, and the kitchens are Massive (another shock when I looked at other apts in Manhattan) and have countertops of granite! In short, if you are looking for a high-rise, great and friendly doorman in the best spot (right off 34th street), not-too-costy (by New York City standards), I highly suggest Plaza West.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,Currently Living,,,4.35,4.19,A,99%,9

It was not the finest since it was pretty much run like a small mom and pop company. The previous mgmt was fair. Even, they tried to have a reasonable place for the residents to live. The new landlords sought to paint a positive picture of themselves after the purchase, brought in a few improvements and renovations, hosted activities in the lobby, and employed a better doorman, but the circumstances rapidly deteriorated as the building proceeded. For all hours, only one elevator is working and building noise begins at about 8 a.m., very noisy on certain days. On some days, construction begins to take place. With many residents moaning, the dust condition is intolerable in many of the apts, but the building appears to dispute that it is a concern even though the accumulation is plainly evident in the empty apts. There are also balconies that are locked off and unreachable. In view of the degraded construction conditions, Vanbarton and Greystar declined to pay money for the conditions of any of the residents. In line with what brand new Manhattan buildings charge with more rooms, better views, and better finishes, they gave us new rates for our apts, around 33 percent more than what we currently pay. I am reasonably sure that the solution is to push out renters who are unable to pay and milk current tenants who are able to afford but do not wish to move. I have a hard time believing after seeing one of the new apts myself that they would be able to fill all the vacancies for what they are paying, particularly because an atlas (a newer building) across the street will give you a 35th floor apt for far less than what they will pay for one of their top (25th) floor apts that is still not high enough to give you an unobstructed view. A mass evacuation of tenants is the latest possibility. There is not enough room to accommodate the volume of move-outs, with a shortage of elevators, continuing construction, and management neglecting to pay much heed. I am confident that it will be a nice place to live until the building is done. But alas, although they choose this new ludicrous name ""the hollingsworth"" it is still the pattern only of renovations per apt worth around $20k. There is the same floor plan and the current property managers are nowhere near as equitable as the former mgmt. It is obvious from my experience with them that benefit is way too high a priority. As usual, the corporate priority, but when you miss your consumers' complete attention or really don't think about them, you end up on the internet with remarks like this. And I'm sure there will be plenty more over the next few years, echoing what I just said.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,5+ years,,4.10,4.26,A,98%,10

You're two blocks North of Prospect Park, 1 ave/block away from 7th ave which is where all the little stores are. You won't be finding chain restaurants and stores here. Smaller local stores only. Lots of coffee shops. Quite quaint. You're about 7 minutes away from the 2,3 train. Grand Army station is clean and big. 

The building has 6 stories in total. New elevator was just put in. Pretty good size. When I moved in, the movers were able to put a 3 seater couch in there, no problem. Intercom system, double door. It feels pretty secure. I was never worried about my packages getting stolen (not in this building, by the tenants or by others in the neighborhood). Garbage room on every floor (you will be asked to break down you cardboards). If the apartment you're looking at faces the garden courtyard + other building, it will be dark, unless you're floor 4 and up. The recess lighting in the apartment works very, very well though. 

I live in a studio. $2200. Roughly around 580 sq ft. My kitchen was not updated, but perfectly serviceable and clean. The kitchen area is a bit separated from the rest of the living space, which makes placing furniture easier. Wood floor, but you will be asked to cover 80% of it with carpet. 96 inch ceiling. Two big windows in the main living space. I have access to the fire escape. Huge tree just outside my windows. Super relaxing. Good size window in the bathroom. Screens on all windows. Three closets, all of which are really high). There's a nook off of the living area, leading off to the bathroom. This is where two of the closets are. This layout frees up wall space in the living area. 

Super lives in the building. The management office is a block away (family-run, super professional, responsive by email/walk-in/phone). They have their own crew of repair men at ready if you need work done. You'll need to hire someone to install your AC though.

And similar to the previous tenant, you need to go through the super to have them replaced (he didn't wear a mask indoors until maybe December 2020, well into the pandemic). Our floors are getting progressively creakier, and they stain like crazy. Same with the countertops - they're impossible to get completely clean. Also, there is no microwave or blinds on the windows, which was a pleasant surprise when we moved in and were waiting for our stuff to arrive. There are 4 washers and 3 driers for the entire building (good luck trying to get one if it's not 2am on a weeknight), and they have the audacity to charge for each load of wash. Our electricity bill is 4x what it was in our previous apartment - the building is clearly leeching electricity from the tenants. It took me eight calls to get in touch with management. We hate this building so much that we're moving out nearly 2 months before our lease is done. The neighborhood itself is fine.

2) Awesome door staff- Sue, Jonathan, Jason, Patrick, and Ron are awesome people and truly take care of the residents. 
3) Subway access- The entrance to the 1 is steps from the front door. You can access any other line from Wall Street, Fulton, or WTC via a short walk. 
4) Rooftop- all residence have access to a rooftop common space on the 26th floor with awesome views of Governors Island. 

Our individual unit faces south with unobstructed views of the Verrazzano Bridge. Residents on the other side of the building have complained of construction noise, but the South side of the building is very quiet. ",,,X,X,,5,4,N,N,Y,Studio,Currently live here,1-2 years,Southside,3.19,4.63,B,99%,11

Be cautious! We had a very bad time. We had several problems with the device, and our allegations were never addressed by the broker, nor was the owner really cooperative while residing in Europe. In order to keep the unit happy and fix problems that should be handled by the owner, we had to pay a lot of extras in addition to all our problems and the terrible publicity. The following were some of the difficulties we had: We noticed bed-bugs and had to leave the apartment for a week. The landlord didn't care for the hotel we were going to stay in. And don't mention all the problems we have experienced since going out (without any help of the owner, nor the broker). For the first month, the air conditioner was not working and it was summer!!! The broker didn't do anything about that, either. Both the preparations had to be made on our own and at our own pace. Showers without adequate cleaning in the toilets and without covered pipes where roaches join. Dormitories without black curtains. Sleeping is difficult. Whether you don't want to waste money or don't want to make a hole in the wall, we had to find those curtains on our own. Our experience was such a nightmare in this unit.

The neighbors are friendly for the most part. Great natural lighting.
Least favorite: not allowed to have a washer machine (though the neighbors have one anyways and it makes our kitchen sink flood). the super is usually rude. any damages take an average of 3 months to be acknowledged before getting fixed. the elevator is usually damaged or out of service. the hot water goes off often usually in the winter when needed the most. The heaters are sometimes still turned on during the spring and summer. Loud creaking floors.lost of damaged pipes and leaks especially in bathroom and kitchen (sometimes in living rooms and bedrooms). If your neighbors have roaches or rats so do you... walls are kinda thin you can hear all of your neighbors. Next to a busy street so a lot of noise even at night and early morning. (Please don’t get mad at the alley cats I’m almost positive they are being harassed and attacked).

It has great storage, a ton of natural light, and is perfect for what I was looking for. It's very close to practically all of the subways and I'm able to get around quite easily. I also love the ornate detailing in the lobby. 

Management can be quite hard to reach, however I've found that they are pretty attentive regardless of this. They cannot be reached by email, only phone. When I moved in, my window was broken. I called and left a message as I was not able to reach anyone. Two days later they showed up with a new window. So while I never actually heard back, they were attentive in getting what I needed. 

We've not had any issues as far as pests or bugs go. Occasionally on trash day you can see a rat out on the sidewalk by the front door, but thankfully that's all we've had to deal with. *knocks on wood*",X,X,X,,X,5,4,N,N,Y,2 bedroom,Currently live here,3-4 years,Southside,5.00,5.75,A,98%,4

The building offers an exterminator once a month which is great so if you get the guy to come in you’ll be in the “infrequent bugs” category.

They own this building and the building across the street 2734. This is pertinent info to know because 2734 has a laundry room but not a kiosk to refill the card so 2734 tenants come over often to not only refill but use our laundry machines as well and there are only 2 washers and 2 dryers (which break often so usually only 1 functional consistently) for the whole building.

The rooftop is a decent area but not kept up well. When they are trying to rent out the place they arrange the furniture nice and sweep. Otherwise its not maintained other times during the year and tenants have even let their dogs crap up there and not picked it up. 

The biggest and most glaring issue was the pest problem.  We always had roaches, both types American and German!! They were kept at bay by monthly exterminator visits but the exterminator just sprayed a little in a few areas and left. It got to the point I would have to tell him all the places he needed to spray. Thankfully I only ever saw 1 or 2 in any of the actual bedrooms over the year I spent there. We were careful to clean up if we ever ate in the bedrooms and they kept to the moist areas of the kitchen and the bathroom. One of the biggest reasons why we could never get rid of them is there were so many cracks in the walls unfilled (between walls and counters). Also gaps between the oven and counterspace so if any food ever fell there we could not clean it thoroughly. Requests to have someone come move the oven so we could clean were ignored. I would just dump bottles of pesticide and boric acid there and hope any pests who ate it were killed and it helped a bit.  

Another issue they had was electrical. There was an electrical fire in the laundry room, you could tell by the burn marks on the ceiling. All they did was paint over it and the carbon monoxide alarm in the hallway beeped for over a month. I reported it to the city but with covid by the time they got to the case, it wasn't beeping any longer and I had moved out. We kept our windows always at least cracked though just in case.

Speaking of cracks there was a huge crack running from the middle of the ceiling down a wall. Also cracks in the title in the bathroom. These are structural issues. They weren't wide enough to have the city deem it unsafe but alarming regardless especially for the price of rent we were paying. A friend of mine who is in architecture even commented on the poor quality of materials they used in building the apartments. 

When covid did hit they were ruthless and harassing to tenants who couldn't pay rent. Enough that some tenants sent around and posted flyers to organize against the property management company. They would rip flyers down as soon as they got put up though. Thankfully, we didn't experience this much first hand but when my roommate was out of work and only a month behind they called him to question what he was doing with his stimulus money which is way out of line as he had spent most of his savings to maintain rent.

If you MUST live here (please consider other options) then the neighborhood and block are safe. You are on the same street as both a police and fire station. You will hear sirens often but nothing that will wake you in the middle of the night. Its close to the station and the street for the most part and is full of new buildings and gentrified. Its a lot cleaner and less frequented than other blocks and cops keep to themselves and are friendly to their POC neighbors (definitely hyperaware of social climate at that station to the point where some interactions seemed forced just so they can show they are friendly).

Steps away from every major subway line into Manhattan, quick and responsive maintenance team, and friendly building staff. Gym is rarely crowded which is another plus. 

The downsides is the immediate area doesn't have a lot to do, which was especially obvious during the lockdowns when we weren't going into Manhattan regularly. A new grocery store just opened up around the corner, plus there's a trader joes opening in a few weeks. The JACX food hall has some solid options for quick takeout plus the new Tacombi, but if you want more nightlife you need to either go to another neighborhood via subway, or it's a 15 minute walk to Vernon Blvd with some more options.

A couple of times after speaking with them, I actually screamed. They have clear rules on what in the long contract you can and can not do, and at this position we don't feel free at home at all. We engaged skilled movers to support us as we moved in and charged the expense of going from door to door. The leadership did not let the movers in and we ended up moving it on our own. This is only one instance. All the way, stuff like this happen, which causes constant hassles. They wouldn't accept sublets, for instance, but if you or your roommate have any plans to alter, I don't know what you might do. They will make them feel really awkward if you have a visitor. My visitors told me that when they were living here, they felt like second-class people. I believe that people who come into the building should be aware of the management so that everyone is safe. Yet they harshly scrutinize the visitors, much like handling a suspect, each time they enter the house. This doesn't mean they are accountable, however. I've seen times where they wanted to discourage people from approaching the house, but the individual didn't listen and just kept walking, and the management just let the individual walk without interfering. I do not feel relaxed living here as an ethnic minority. Since you are [my ethnicity], we can't understand your spelling, they will say things like that. There was a girl who I don't know who lost her ID once. They stopped me as I entered the building and asked if I knew her because we were both [of my ethnicity]. Their problem goes beyond being disrespectful and insensitive, I guess. I still feel like they're purposely causing problems. They made something up basically that I didn't mean, said that I said it, and found fault with me. I don't even know they will give me problems just because I'm posting here, so I wouldn't be intimidated into being quiet (they would take what I said, and make slight changes in language to fully alter the context of what I said). Generally speaking, when living here, I don't feel able to do as I'm entitled to do, because I'm always afraid that they will find a way to cause me problems and say that I broke a law.

Ever since I moved in, on Every day, I haven't slept past 8am. Construction takes place 7 days a week and it starts at 7 a.m. on weekdays (they began at 6:45 a.m. when they first started, but I think they had a lot of complaints) and at 8 a.m. on weekends. The house is so noisy that your TV can not even be heard if you leave your windows open. I believe like I deserve a good environment for $3000/month for a one-bedroom. Not to mention that because we couldn't open our windows in the summer because of the noise, our AC bill was $430 (not energy friendly units) at its peak - so we essentially lived with our dog in our 10x11 bedroom the next month. They decided to raise our rent to $3090 when it came time to extend our contract (which is not bad in comparison, but you'd think we'd take a break from the construction). So, I went to the rental department and told them we were interested in moving to a garden-facing apartment. We needed to have some peace and quiet and also found that about $500/month was cheaper for the rent. She told me that because they're updating (aka: investing more money) and that these units were usable NOW, and we were not going NOW, Rockrose would not encourage people to move units.

This building has a great location (near the F and A/C lines) and only takes about 20 mins to get to midtown Manhattan. It is also located right next to The Navy Yard (with Wegman's Grocery Store)/Dumbo/Brooklyn Bridge Park and not too far from Fort Greene and Downtown Brooklyn. The building is also gated, is a co-op of multiple families, and has a door man/elevator. When I moved in, the apartment had just been fully renovated with new appliances and fixtures. The bedrooms are big enough to fit a Queen sized bed (however, one side will have to be against the wall) and one has a large walk-in closet. There is a smaller coat closet in the living room. Laundry in the basement.

The downsides to this apartment are, it is located very close to the bridge/BQE (though the noise is normal city noise, so not loud). Your immediate neighborhood is on a busy street, though. Also, the two bedrooms are the only rooms that have a window, so the interior living room in the apartment can get very dark and is a little small. This apartment would be really perfect for 1 person, but is just a little tight for two (but we made it work). Other downsides, there aren't a ton of moderately priced restaurants/shops right outside your door. There is Dumbo that is very close-by, but you go through/tire of these restaurants very quickly (most of them are good though!). Myrtle Avenue in Fort Greene is nearby and has a lot of restaurants/art/shops, but it is about a 15 minute walk away. Overall, great place, but can the not having enough windows/sunlight has been my biggest issue. ",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,2.98,4.75,B,94%,1

- Front desk is professional and great
- Great views/ prices were decent when I was there
- Pet Friendly
- Around a lot of stuff / good location

Cons:
Building Management is grossly disorganized. I've lived in 4 buildings over the course of 12 years in nyc and Marc/Monian group (the owning management company) are by far the worst. Examples:

- It took them 3-4 months AFTER my lease ended the first year for them to renew it. It took serious pushing on my side and was met with disorganization/ starting from scratch several times. I had to figure out what they were and weren't doing with my autopay rent and keep a separate ledger tracking it. They had me re-do my security deposit (I don't know why). Many emails generated a ""Zendesk"" auto reply and were marked as closed successfully and never replied to. Calls always went to voicemail, many calls were never returned. Then every once in a while a 'Welcome' email talking about applying to and getting a lease at the Marc. After making some progress with someone (they rarely give their names and never an individuals email address that you can keep a thread going on, always zendesk -> new thread -> easily lost/radio silence), a new person starts a new email saying ""how can I help / what's going on"". It was really quite a headache, a tenet should not be the one seriously pushing building management (and Monian is like an actual, multi-building owning, company) to get their stuff straight.

- Took 800$ off my Security Deposit refund after I moved out. No explanation as to why. (I moved out after not wanting to deal with renewing the lease with them again... really was that bad/unprofessional). Following up with them now but as noted above, stuck in zendesk / help desk purgatory...

- Gym card key worked for two months, then they switched the system and it never worked again for the remaining two years I was there. Followed up/ was told it was fixed many times never was. Always felt like a fool going and checking with my gym closed and always ended up locked out. Fool me once... Eventually they just left the door open but there were many times I had to find a handy man / go to the front desk to get them to open it. Annoying when you're paying ~700$ a year for that gym membership. It's more about their complete inability to fix it/ would openly say things that weren't true just to avoid dealing with the problem than anything else. This pattern was repeated many times as you can see from the above.

There were other smaller offenses (moving in and out headaches) but in summary just overall felt building management was always dodging doing their job.  Really a quite poor interaction with them overall. Maybe others' experience are different but at least for me they consistently let me down, to a level of being straight up unprofessional / causing serious headaches for the tenet.",X,X,X,,X,3,4,Y,Y,Y,1 bedroom,Less than 1 year ago,3-4 years,Westside,4.87,4.67,A,99%,6

- no laundry room (and personal wash/dryer are forbidden) and no laundromat on the block, major bummer
- no bike room, no mailing room (package thefts is a daily thing here)

They would sneak in our apt when I was out during the day. They would use the basement door in the kitchen.

Let’s start with the good because there are some good. The security at the front desk is very polite and will go out of the way to help you if needed. Ms. Stella is everyone’s favorite and we love having her around. The building is close to nearly everything you need. 4 supermarkets within 3 blocks in either direction, numerous fast food, restaurants, and hidden ge, bars throughout. Public and private schools within a block of the building. Great area if you’re a young adult or have young children in school.

Now for the bad. Let’s start with the amenities. We’re suppose to have a fully functioning laundry room and a playground in the back of the building. The playground has been closed down for over ten years. You see the empty slide and the seating and would think it was open. The laundry machines always break down. Out of the 6 washers and 6 dryers we have, only 2 washers and 4 dryers actually work currently. It’s been this way for the past year. Elevators have a tendency to break down. Most of the time we’re left with one working elevator, but there’s been occasions where both have broken down. Horrible when you live on one of the higher floors. There’s been two occasions when I’ve walked into the hallway on my floor and have seen homeless people sleeping in the staircase or in the hallway. Oh and if something is broken or damaged, prepare to wait a long time to get it fixed. We had mold problems in my apartment that they just scraped and painted over thinking that’s all you needed to fix it. Numerous times when our apartment would flood from water coming from our neighbors upstairs. We have a massive pest problem with both roaches and mice. And finally got a new refrigerator and stove after requesting it for years because our appliances weren’t working properly.

While there’s some good in this building, there’s so much negative that I think this place is overpriced for the service you get.",,,X,,X,3,3,Y,Y,Y,2 bedroom,Currently live here,Currently live here,Eastside,4.70,4.69,A,99%,2

The landlords raised their own family in this space and you can tell they care. Everything isn't brand new but you will have a great working relationship with the landlords for things as long as you treat the space as your home. They are happy to have your pets and such there as well. Pay rent on time and take care of the space and it's a wonderful place to live. They only raise the rent slightly each time you renew so that's not bad either. The ONLY downside of this space is that heat is not included and since it is an old building it does take a lot to heat this space. If you keep this in consideration when you make your budget this will definitely impact you in the cold months. ,X,X,X,X,,5,5,N,N,Y,2 bedroom,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,4.92,3.92,A,98%,1

Here are some of the cons. The new VanDer Water next door is way over scheduled for construction completion, so there’s constant noise from that. The larger 2nd bedroom has lights shining into your bedroom window 24/7 from the new construction. The supervisor, while nice, is quick to respond but slow to act. The radiators all make way too much noise, especially the living room one that sprays water and is not tilting enough. The restaurants are decent enough but there aren’t a lot of them. The larger store amenities are located near 125th st station which can be sketchy at times. You get no amenities aside from laundry in building. 

Some of the pros include being able to have large breed dogs here, great location for students and if you want a more suburban feel while living in Manhattan, and close proximity to both Riverside Park and Morningside Park. This apartment has a full-sized kitchen. There’s laundry in the building. The neighborhood 122nd and south is wonderful to walk around in.

The apartments on this complex are spacious compared to most of Manhattan and have a lot of light.  If space is your concern on a small budget, this is a no-brainer, especially if you attend Columbia University or City College.  

If peace is your necessity, then look elsewhere. The buildings on this block have a plywood floor with a 7-inch echo chamber cavity for plumbing and electrical and no insulation and sheetrock that makes the ceiling for the neighbor below you. Simple footsteps sound like stomps as the echo chamber amplifies every little sound you and your neighbors make.  You will hear them laugh, sneeze, and cry, and they will listen to you.  To make matters worse, the neighbors are not respectful of their other neighbors and have many parties with their doors propped open, with loud music, even on work nights.  Drug dealers occasionally sell in the hallways, and there is no surveillance for your safety.  If you have a package, it will get stolen as there is no mailroom, and UPS and USPS are awful.  God forbid you ever have to walk to the post office to pick up a package on 142nd street in the middle of the day.  

Five years ago, this apartment had bed bugs, but the management quickly took care of it. Electrical costs are relatively inexpensive, gas and water are included.  Spectrum provides Internet, so no Verizon Fios if you are expecting fast upload speeds.

If you have problems with your apartment, you will have to reach out to the Super as it is difficult to reach the landlord. The management company is quite awful, and the main guy who runs it is impossible to get ahold of. ",,,X,,,2,1,N,N,N,3 bedroom,Currently live here,5+ years,Southside,4.07,6.14,A,97%,1

Something that you need to know is that is not a “luxury” building as they claimed, and because that is overpriced, but it can compensate a little because the location, one big bonus is that you can see the Macy’s parade if your apartment have a window that face the street, the last year that I was there the entire floor had a mice problem, we got one inside the apartment, was at night and the staff wasn’t able to do anything for you because they needed approved by the management office, had to figure it out my self, but the next day I contacted management and they send a exterminator and he checked the apartment every week.

Not only were we harassed and threatened by one of their doorman staff (whom, has since then been terminated), but we've had an intoxicated tenant come to our door and nearly harm us with a knife (of which the building did NOTHING to resolve), and our dog was recently attacked by another tenant's dog (and you guessed it, the building has taken NO action to resolve our concern).

The superintendent doesn't work weekends, so if you have an issue Friday night, expect a response the following Monday or Tuesday.

The property management team fails to respond to calls/emails from tenants (known issue); so if you get into an altercation with another tenant and you are physically harmed, don't expect a reply back, just deal with the pain.
Someone parked in your parking spot? Too bad, even though you pay $200+ a month for the designated spot.

Just because you pay monthly for an in-building storage unit, that doesn't mean your personal items are safe from being discarded, since the management team and in-house management have poor communication and don't update their records.

Your UPS package arrived at 9am, but you won't be able to pick it up until 8-8:30pm. Oh it's urgent? Too bad - It takes their staff several hours (up to 24 hours) to prepare tenant mail.

Lastly, your rent per month here is similar to that of what an average mortgage would be, but it feels like you're living in the projects.
(Fancy waterfall in the lobby, though. So, at-least there's that..)

This building is nothing but smoke and mirrors.

The apartments themselves are spacious and the place is fine, but I don't think it's worth it for the amount you spend. Maintenance: Not exactly the best, from the elevator (just replaced) to the lobby floors, the tile floors are cracked. As if it were a high school desk, the elevator walls are all ""keyed"". Just to get somebody to look at a leaky faucet or a faulty microwave and then to finally get it repaired, it takes a lot of calls and bothering mgmt, yeah, there is another story. People: Most of the people in the building are fine, except for the sometimes insane woman who scream at you for standing next to her and smash the elevator walls when you attempt to leave; yeah, but don't worry about her, it took 2 years for the building to have her craziness booted out. There are still less and less true persons living in the house who are remaining there due to the recession. They appear to have made it into some sort of restaurant. And a lot of foreign faces and non-New Yorkers distracting you with all their luggage on what to see in the city or getting in your way while you literally want to enter or exit the hotel. Management: It's fun to joke with and chat to the management, just wait before you need to do something. On his lunch break or before 10am or after 4pm, the ""live in sup"" who seems to never be around, particularly on weekends and does not try to get in contact with him, takes his time to repair it. Since they often seem to tie up the elevators when they are most needed, they prefer to use the repair elevator to carry the garbage down from each floor when people come home from work, such as between 5 and 7. It's wonderful that they're clean, but it's just not a good time to force you to sit, what it feels like to be, to have an elevator free forever. Building Construction: There is not a month that goes by that I am not woken up by the lovely sound of jackhammers on a Saturday morning as they patch the entry ways of the Port Authority. Because of the latest high rise across the street going up, I can only picture things getting worse and now renovation is set to commence on the buildings immediately to the east of this one to make room for a new high-rise hotel. The place is a nice place to live, aside from all the problems that I have, as long as you never have a problem that needs to be solved and if you are not disturbed by bad maintenance. It was OK for me except for the cost tag, when you spend upwards of 4300 on an apt, you expect better service style, especially when reasonably comparable locations in the region are around the same cost, but offer more facilities and better maintenance. So, you might want to recommend it if you have an apt there for a bargain, but if you have the money to spare, I'd probably go to an actual ""luxury"" rental building.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,4.85,5.75,A,99%,17

The management is wonderful and the building was really clean. Noise was and still appears to be a big concern in this house. Construction was constant in positions above and below. Mgmt wasn't in a position to do something about it, but it was just something we had to deal with. We have protested a number of times, but little has changed. It made it really annoying to try to work from home once in a while, or even to take a day off, because the noise was very bad. The roof was a very good place to hang out, $5,000 for our membership was a little high, but at least it kept it good and empty. I'm going to agree with the others that some of the management of the Oasis, especially the manager of Brendon, was really smug, without any excuses while any of the services were not running. For $5,000 a year, you're not wanting a hot tub to be out of service for 2 months, or locker rooms with steam and sauna to be unavailable for months at a time. There was no compromise, no free month for the hassle, let's just agree that their customer support was terrible. But Bethany the teacher was fantastic and worth the entrance fee. All and all, we came in at a really decent rate when we signed our lease for 635 square feet of 1BR, it was $2,700/month. We got a free month and six months out from the fitness club.

There are peloton cycles, elliptical cross trainers, treadmills, and weights. There's an outdoor pool and rooftop, but it's an insane way to do it in the heat, so be careful of that. My main concern is that the monthly electrical costs are exceedingly high. I was not aware of this prior to moving in. Come winter, though, our average bill was $300. It is totally insane and you get no answer when you want to explain the logic behind this. In all my years of renting, I've never seen such a big energy bill. My roommate and I went to shut down our heat on several weekends, and the cost doesn't change. Because of this, I will not be renewing my contract. When you look at this house, make sure to take this into account. A 12-year lease with an energy bill of $300 will cost you $3,600. It's already $1800 to share with other individuals.

Yes, when you first walk into this building you will be wowed by the amenities and gorgeous interior decorations. The building itself and units are brand new, which are aesthetically pleasing but there are many issues to be wary of. First, management is almost always unresponsive (takes about a month and 5-6 phone calls, emails, and text messages before anything’s addressed). Second, many of the neighbors are rude and obnoxious who don’t know how to live in a luxury type building much less respect other's peace and quiet (I.e., hostile and defensive, constantly slamming their doors shut, destroying the common areas, kids playing basketball throughout the day, shouting and cursing). Third, safety concerns are a recurring issue (I.e., open or stolen packages, loitering in the lobby, random people walking into the building, and just to give a sense of how unsafe the building is— many have a ring-type doorbell installed in a building already outfitted with cameras). Fourth, the neighborhood is not worth it. If you are going to be paying a high premium for rent and live in a lavish apartment, take your money elsewhere. Past Franklin Ave, the neighborhoods are not very welcoming and feel uncomfortable at night. It is very common to see people loitering on the sidewalks (i.e., talking loudly, smoking weed, and drinking while blasting music in their cars disturbing everyone’s peace). Lastly, the closest subway stop is a little far (nearly a 10 min walk) and the 2/5 trains are not that convenient unless you work in the FiDi area. Additionally, the trains nor the station feel very safe at night.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,4.56,6.54,A,94%,2

By way of background, I have lived in New York for nearly 14 years, and have probably lived in upwards of 10 different apartments, all downtown - in the Financial District and the West Village. So, I am reasonably well-versed in expectations for apartments in this city, at varying levels of rent. 

We (my fiance and I) rented a two-bedroom, 1.5-bath duplex, moved in just prior to COVID, and were sincerely hoping that this would be a place we would stay for multiple years. Let's be honest - moving in this city is a hassle, and we certainly weren't looking to move again during a pandemic. But here we are, moving again, because our experience at 100 Jane was that bad. 

Let me start with the positive. If you solely care about location/neighborhood, this might be the place for you. I stand by my view that the West Village is NYC's best neighborhood - especially if you are a foodie or enjoy a real neighborhood vibe. Jane Street is also lovely, and has great access to the best of the West Village, and also to Meatpacking, if that's your cup of tea. 

But unfortunately, the neighborhood is only part of the package - and with COVID-related changes, I'd say it's probably of less importance now than in the past. My fiance and I work from home full time (finance nerds), and have been stuck here 24/7 for a year now. It has not been good. Here are a few of the main issues:

1). Rodents. We had a mouse/mice (never figured out if there was more than one) problem for 5+ months - this is how long it took Rockrose to rid us of the problem. Mind you, we were cohabitating with rodents during COVID, when we were home all the time, which made this especially unacceptable. I had to send email after email, complaining to the super, property manager and other Rockrose employees to finally get this solved. Not to mention, the first extermination company they sent out put rat poison into our HVAC vents, in dust form. Great to be breathing that in all day, every day, unbeknownst to us. 

2) Noise. Oh God, the noise. First off, there is a major construction project happening across the street (if you live on the Washington Street side) that is very loud, starts at ~5am every day, and has been incessant. Second, there is constant noise inside the building. I don't know if Rockrose is remodeling the entire thing, but it certainly seems like it - as we speak, I'm listening to very loud drilling that sounds like it's about to come through the ceiling. Again, really fun that this has been an issue at LEAST once/week while we've both been working from home.

3) Super/management. I already mentioned the issues we had with rodents and management's lack of attention, but there have also been several other times when we submitted a maintenance request or sent an email to the super and received no response. My fiance bought me flowers for Valentines Day that got stuck in the building's package locker system (don't even get me started on that, it's happened multiple times)...it took the super three business days to deal with it, and clearly the flowers were dead by that point. Did we get an apology? Nope.

4) Package room not secure. I had a package ripped open and the contents stolen. The cops came to the building to address this - apparently there were multiple packages stolen. The building has since installed a key fob system to deter this, but to be fair, the package room is still left open, unsecured until (I believe) midnight each night. I have also had several other missing packages. Thankful that Amazon is so great about this, but Rockrose has been of no help.

5) Young people partying. This is a very young building. Our neighbors are luckily very respectful, but we have walked by a number of units on our floor where there have been loud parties (during COVID nonetheless). Recently, the cops came to break up a loud party across the hall. 

I could go on, but honestly the other issues we've had have been quite petty compared to the five listed above. I'd also say that value for money is poor, but that's partially a neighborhood issue. The most eye-opening problem was the lack of management concern about our rodent problem. If this was a building that did NOT have a vermin issue, wouldn't they want to address ASAP, so it does not become an issue? Hmmm...makes you wonder how pervasive this is. And personally, for me, rodents are a dealbreaker. ",X,X,X,,,5,2,Y,Y,N,2 bedroom,Currently live here,1-2 years,Eastside,4.19,2.93,B,99%,6

Nice views, nice place, F train stops, perfect overall. In the 1 year I lived there, I never had any problems with the heating. The toilets have a clutch inside with their own space heaters. There was a large fridge and a dishwasher in the kitchen. Profound sink. Toilets didn't have the best flush. In the hallways, they stink of marijuana and tobacco all the time. Usually silent, neighbours were often heard disputing. My pets loved it—so much space, so much good walking. The area's average food. It's tough to get food shipped there. During rush hour, the F train is a disaster and you'll have to wait before you get on for a few to come in. As long as visitors swarm New York City ferry stops there, tram is a fun ride and is 100 percent the best. The main building door was never closed, the laundry rooms were filthy and crowded and still had broken equipment, and I stole a few parcels, which is why they probably don't leave them anymore. This building's weakness is mgmt. A bunch of cheap greedy landlords waiting to move out or transfer on from rent-controlled people and then renovate and jack up the prices of those apartments. I had one of those units renovated and it was pretty decent, but for those who are not being heard by mgmt, I feel bad. Maintenance has become very reactive. Overall, given how many units they had to service, I had positive experiences with them.

Even though we are living through Covid-19 now and the facilities are closed (the Sun Deck is now open), the services have been on a par with a 5-star hotel (I should know, I got used to 5-star life in Qatar and Bahrain).  The staff here bend over backward to help on an immediate basis and it's clean and safe.  Safety was a huge concern for me and this place feels extremely safe. 

The gym and the lounge are amazing (when operational).  A few times during lockdown, I had to print some documents and the leasing office printed them for me for free.  And the laundry/post office are very convenient (open Monday to Saturday) as is the small laundry on the 16th floor.

I personally like the fact that my studio is so spacious, the appliances are top-notch and the heater/air conditioner is very powerful.  The bill for the water and a/c|heater never goes over $200 on top of the base rent.

I love that I'm literally 1 minute away from the water and there are so many restaurants and shops nearby.

There are some downsides: the building is aging, some of the electricity sockets don't work (I didn't call the management about it because fixing it would mess with my internet).  Sometimes it takes 5 minutes for the hot water to come up (tricky in the winter when you're naked in the shower waiting for freezing cold water to become warm).

My roommate decorated and felt perfect for 2 working women in the city. The rooms are decent sized flex room a little bit bigger with a Juliette balcony and no closet and the true room with two mirrored closets. Wouldn't recommend a queen bed in either room, eats up all the space. We had no issues with neighbors but the ones above held parties sometimes and you could hear the ceiling giving every time they jumped. The financial district made any qualm i had with the apartment worth it. Literally a two-minute walk from Fulton Station with all the bars, restaurants, and fast food you can desire. Pace University is behind the block and never had any issues there. CityMD and a hospital a block away, Whole Food and Target about a 10m walk but 55 Fulton 2 blocks away. 

If you are not a heavy sleeper I wouldn't recommend this place because not only is there a hotel directly across the street with large screens that flash all night, that hotel has a bar inside, on a one-way street. Uber/Lyft's are not patient. I got pretty used to it, but it can get pretty loud especially considering how long the line gets. If you come back late you will find people who are waiting for their Uber's sitting on the step up to the apartment (and occasionally a homeless man!).

I lived with an awesome view on the first floor and my rent was subsidized at $600.00. Indeed, back then, we had rats. I feel sorry about all these unsuspecting folks, as a native New Yorker.

I'll leave it to the reader to determine by my comments below... 

You really have to be on management with repairs as they will forget or better yet not respond and send you straight to voicemail(each and every time). You're paying high rent for low brow services because that's the NYC dream right?. The super is cool but is barely in the building so it's a hit or miss. I lost track of how many misses. The apartment itself was nice but horrible management brought this score down. If it's worth having extremely terrible management for a ""nice"" apartment then have at it, otherwise look elsewhere.

It's not like I was asking much of them. I don't like talking to people i don't know without purpose especially anyone house/apartment related in NYC. Just once I would like management to be at least average to match a nice well to do apartment but both can't coexist in this area of Brooklyn it seems.

Anyways, as far as the neighborhood is concerned. You get a different feeling from each block you walk up. Which is a good and bad thing depending how you look at it but that's NYC in general. Only bad side I think would be how far we were from gyms. There is a YMCA near by if you're okay with going to those in 2021. (no judging here)

We were also within walking distance of the B/Q and if I'm feeling like Usain Bolt one evening the 2/5.

The go-to supermarket would be the C-Town near the B/Q, looks clean and very well kept. Hey maybe they should be the management.

Final thoughts: nice area, far gym, nice apartment, terrible management, cool semi-live-in super,

The roof deck has the best views of the city. It's the reason why my fiance and I moved here. We also have an amazing view from our 10th floor apartment. 

Washer and dryer in the apartment. Bigger washer and dryers available on a separate floor.

BUT...

The location, while close to LIC, Astoria, and Sunnyside, may seem ideal, but the constant wind creates a vortex of garbage that you become enveloped in as soon as you step outside. The wind is not the building fault - but if they cleaned around the building, this would not be the case.

There is a communal outdoor patio with a grill, but it's first come first serve... And there's no time limit or sign up sheet. It's whoever gets there first and however long they want to stay.

There is a gym... But it's been closed for 90% of our stay. We forget that it's available now.

There is a communal indoor room... With nothing in it. No fridge. No games. No tv. Just a table and chairs.

The toilets back up every now and again.

There are no screens on the windows. Good luck keeping mosquitos out if you want fresh air (and yes - they come up to the top of the building and invaded our 10th floor apartment).

There are no drawers in the apartments. Only huge cabinets that are so deep that you need to put your entire body through. We had to buy our own cabinet shelving ""sections"" on amazon to make it work.

The ceiling is starting to crack. We find paint chips on our floor. The super says it's ""settling""... Not sure if that how a building settles.

1. When I rented the apartment was given to me in unclean condition. The toilet was not cleaned for months, the curtain was dirty as hell and the floor was covered with dust.
2. The sink cabinet was made of wood and it had been spoiled and the management did not even bother to replace it.
3. The building management seemed to have trained front desk managers to be rude to anyone who rents. Owing to unclean condition I could not move all my stuff and I was asked several questions on why I was moving stuff afterwards.
4. When I left the apartment, I left the apartment in clean condition and fortunately had taken photographs. I also asked Super to assist review the apartment before could hand over the keys. Instead he never showed up. To my surprise, I was handed over security deposit with 50% deduction. When I reached management they shared Super's report which was full of lies. The report claimed it was littered with stuff which contradicted how I left. I shared photographs with management but they were unresponsive. Finally I had this resolved via claims court.
5. In the summer the AC was unresponsive and the heat was simply unbearable. Despite repeated requested the AC was never fixed.
6. I recently came across news that another building owned by ATA Enterprises had an unfortunate incident where the lift malfunctioned causing a young individual to loose his life. This was despite several warnings regarding lift. I was not surprised at the callous attitude of building management in not responding to lift requests.
 
This was my first New York City rental and I learned many things regarding renting. First apartment is expected to be received in clean condition. The building management may not listen to you as in this case clearly the management was hand-in-glove with the super deposit deduction.

Stay away from any of the building owned by ATA Enterprises is what I would say. New York City has too many building and you can easily give ATA Enterprises a pass.

The Super manages a few buildings so he’s not always able to come quickly for issues, but he is really nice, responsive, and efficient. The Building manager can be challenging to work with sometimes, and the landlord doesn’t live in the country.

Although the building lacks the facilities that other buildings have, the cost represents a good value for the location. Such facilities include gyms, conference rooms and a rooftop with plants. For me, these facilities are not necessary, so I'm glad that I don't have to pay for them. A friendly building with decent, fast service is what you will get. In the one-bedroom apartments, you get really nice closet space (not sure about the two bedroom units). Most likely, you'll have great light, particularly around the 6th floor or above.

For 2 1/2 years now, my wife and I have lived in a one-bedroom apartment (we were the first residents in our house, moving in only after the construction was completed) and were generally very satisfied with the building. It is a huge house, which by default has advantages (lots of administration, facilities, amenities, apartments available, etc.) and drawbacks (lots of neighbors). The structure is now virtually brand new, and is very well managed. It's nice the doorman, cleaning and repair men. They distribute packages easily, send shipments of food, etc. The boss is a rules sticker, so that is a positive thing, I guess. The rent-stabilized design is also good, especially in the past two years when all of my friends renting in the city have seen their rentals rise by 10-30 percent and our rents have clipped by 2.5-3 percent each year. It's true that to a certain degree, Glenwood costs that in the initial rent, but the longer you remain in the house, the more you benefit from it. They still have a variety of affordable rent units (low-income renters under a special scheme in New York City), which leads some people to wonder, but I have to admit that I find them to be more polite and respectful than some of the market-rate tenants. We don't even use the facilities (gym, pool, screening room), so we can't talk to that. The diner in the house, Casa Nonna, is also nice. It is too expensive to eat many days a week, but it is a high quality restaurant with a large bar, polite managers, and good Italian cuisine, which is a spot for us to take guests, meet friends after work, etc. Especially nice are their pizzas! Our apartment itself is roomy, has plenty of closet space, and gets decent light. Really nice soundproofing between the apts - and for the front gates, we never heard from our neighbours. It's nice to get our own washer/dryer, and you can see that they invested some cash on appliances of good quality, bathroom fixtures, etc. The field is the only con to Emerald Green (and it's a major one). In the two years after we moved in, it has changed and will continue to do so, but it's still visually disgusting, charmless, and full of sketchy residents, visitors, bored youth, dealers, and other unwelcome people. The location is convenient for the Port Authority, Penn Station, and Lincoln Tunnel, but I certainly understand if some people do not feel comfortable walking around at night (especially single women). I've never had a problem in that field, but here, common sense is a must.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,4.50,4.26,A,99%,11

Favorite things:
-Steps away from the Q train. 90 second walk. 7-8 minutes away from the 6.
- Great Natural Light
-Walkable
-Laundry in Basement
-Clean hallways/building management
- You can walk to the management office
-Retail/rest/leisure is all walkable: Rumble,Chipotle,Starbucks, H&M, Gap, Ulta, Lululemon, ETC
- Safe neighborhood
-(The best Gelatto/Sorbet/Icecream spots In the summer)
-Pet Friendly neighborhood
- Close to Two Parks
-Beautiful trees line the side walks
-10-15 minutes from Midtown
- Super is responsive
-Close to the hospital
-AC comes with the unit

CONS
- No elevator in a 5 floor walk up
-Noise pollution from bars can be frustrating especially on the weekends or hotter weather
-Construction is currently happening across the street
- the building is old & Dry may need a humidifier
-Not Very diverse neighborhood 
-Sirens due to proximity to hospital

This is a very safe walkable neighborhood, from restaurants, to nails, to ice cream or shopping you can get just about anything you need walking ten minutes or less. The neighbors in this building have been helpful and kind since I moved in. And its nice to hear the birds chirping outside in the mornings.

The maintenance team is very responsive when submitting a maintenance request. We got our dishwasher replaced in a few days.

Some small gripes:
The 4 elevators are slow, and at least one is often in independent service. At rush hours you might have to wait for the 2nd or 3rd car.
The doorman will receive packages, but (typically) will not get packages for you from the package room. You have to go to a separate desk that has strict hours (and is closed on Sunday)

The building is old, from 1893, and I’m guessing the elevator was installed in the 1960s. It falls within an UWS historic district. So no worries about high rises for now. It is legally described as a tenement, though all apartments now of course have their own bathrooms. Ceilings are 10.5 feet high. Windows are thick double pane sliders and really help keep outside sounds outside. The wood plank floors in most units are old and creaky. You can definitely hear your neighbors walk around. Though, upon vacancies, the landlord often upgrades the floors.  The interior walls are typically thin nyc walls, as I can hear my neighbors phone conversations. The boiler keeps the temp pretty well regulated during the winter and I never hear any radiator knocking. Once in a while I have run out of hot water for my morning showers, but less so during lockdown.  All units have newer circuit breakers.  There are some water leaks that occur between floors in the past (old plumbing), though they do get fixed fast, the walls often show seepage. The recycle room is evidence of past damage. Yes, an occasional cockroach or rouge mouse can be seen, but I’m sure that varies from apartment to apartment. I hear them skittering between the walls, but I’ve got no holes in the walls (check behind the stove where the gas pipe is fitted). There are rats in the street side garbage bins, but that’s most every building. The exterminator comes by monthly. The property has professional management (out on Long Island), and is a small property investor/owner who doesn’t participate in the day to day. The super is a married man with a nice young kid and wife, though he is sometimes a bit grumpy but honest. He has lived here for at least 15 years. But, he does the best he can keeping this old building hallways clean, snow cleared, and the trash and recycling out as needed. He definitely works hard to keep it together. The neighbors generally keep to themselves, with many living here for several decades. There is one crazy in the building who rarely peeks outside.

Yes, the amenities were great but it wasn't included in the rent so it cost extra month-to-month. Some of the amenities were shutdown for months at a time and we would still be paying the same. Other small things like the gym water fountain got clogged and it remained unfixed for months as well.

I lived there for 2 years and looking back, it was difficult to really call this building home.  The building management did a horrible job. They lacked action and were not attentive regarding tenant complaints. There were numerous complaints about noise on the park side when there was a big industrial fan that would run. Management would only send out emails saying there was nothing they could do about it. There were complaints about the strong smell of marijuana from the hallway eventually seeping into one's apartment as well. Again, this was taken lightly at first and only when there was a mention of health problems did they take action. The most they did was again send emails to everybody with a reminder of smoking policy. There were complaints of loud music coming from neighbors but again, the only action taken was to send a mass email. I had to resort to calling the cops for these noise complaints because building management couldn't do anything to improve the repeated occurrences of neighbor noise. In fact, this behavior never improved which led me to decide not to renew my lease.

Even moving out was a horrible experience. It's interesting that building management decided to be on top of things when there's an opportunity to charge you, but when it's about your daily living situation, they are not at all responsive. They wanted to charge extra for damages that was due to inherent flaws in installation and wasn't even from natural wear-and-tear. 

At the end of it all, the nice things about living there were mostly superficial like the amenities and the view. But I would not recommend this building because despite the great looking fixtures and common area, it was very difficult to make living there feel like home.",,X,,,,1,1,N,Y,N,Studio,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,Not sure,3.92,10.00,A,95%,1

Some downsides are that the trucks are loud in the mornings, the building is VERY old and honestly will need some renovations soon to the cabinetry and bathroom. 
Absolutely negotiate your rent if you see this place on the market because of the old building quirks are bound to come up and you’ll be thankful you negotiated.

There was also one outlet that was very poorly wired and would spark when we had to flip the breaker, so we had to call the fire department to come break into the wall to disconnect the outlet.

Let's start with the positives though:
* Lived here for approximately five years
* Safe (for the most part)
* Great location if you're a west-sider (1 train on 137th)  and lots of great places popping up just north of the building on both Broadway and Amsterdam
* Lots of aspiring musicians and artists so if you feel the need to ""Sing out, Louise,"" no one will complain

Now for the bad:
* There was a leak which seemed to come from the pipes in the wall between the kitchen and bathroom.  The super came, looked at it, and never came back.  This was like this for the majority of our time in the apt.  It didn't make the apartment unlivable, however we did wonder when the wall was going to fall.
* Giant rats became a massive problem outside the apartment and they worked their way into the walls.  They started chewing away at the the wall by the water valve to the toilet.  Zero help from anyone and we lived in fear that they would come out.  Once this happened we made the decision to move out.  
Note: Rodents don't come out of wall spaces (especially during the day) unless it is overcrowded and they are looking for space.  Let that sink in.
* Teen drug dealers began hanging out on the stoop. ",X,,X,,X,3,3,Y,N,Y,2 bedroom,1-2 years ago,5+ years,Eastside,4.57,6.14,A,97%,1

Hence moving in and out is quite challenging. Parking restricted and charged for extended period of times and very limited, hence using nearby garage is recommended for those who do own a vehicle. However on the flip side the location is very convenient. Two subway stations nearby. Central Harlem commercial district and the Metro-North station within walking distance. Columbia University and CUNY's upper Manhattan campus (CCNY) is within walking distance. 
Soundproofing is not ideal and since the area is quite busy street noise is expected even at night. Building has an old central heating system and individual apartment controls are not available, and they might be insufficient to some. However personal thermometers seldom recorded a temperature low enough in violation of the city heating laws. Also since it was controlled by the super which is part-time instead of live in, the heating schedule during fall and spring can be uncomfortable. (Super might leave on when it's warm enough, while leave it off when it's cold, especially at night). Each apartment has one window available to install an AC. No AC slots which means that window cannot be used when an AC is installed and sunlight might be blocked. A $5 surcharge will be added to monthly rent bills for the entire 12 month lease if an AC is installed, regardless if it was removed during winter months. Also soundproofing might get worse as the windows are essentially open at all times. 
Interior amenities are basic. The building is renovated, although the interior is still far from modern looking. There's a full open kitchen and a full bath in each unit, no microwaves pre installed so tenants need to bring their own. No laundry in unit or on site, and the kitchens have no dishwashers. Strict prohibition of self-installation of such appliances are strictly enforced, including even portable ones. There is a dry cleaners right around the corner, and a self-service laundry mat with plenty of machines right across the street. No pets allowed. 
Rent is legally stabilized and regulated at a relatively affordable price. Application is easy, and even for applicants with not sufficient income or credit approval can be expected without a need of guarantors. However it's usually the tenants' responsibility to pay for the broker's fee. Some flexibility provided in the lease, such as flexible termination dates during the summer. However there're no short term leases available. 
Other things: hallways extremely narrow, seemingly no heating during cold months and definitely no A/C during hot months. Super is part-time instead of live in. Trash & recycling can be insufficient at times. However security inside the building is ensured. CCTV installed in the hallway and there's an audio intercom. Since it's small with a limited number of residents the super or even other residents recognize all residents and frequent guests. Most tenants are decent and quiet. Loud gatherings and troublesome behaviors are usually rare. The neighborhood itself is acceptably safe, although still less so than many other neighborhoods. However A.M. safety measures are usually sufficient while tenants are inside the building. 
Conclusion: an OK place to live if need walkable access to Columbia/CCNY or anything in the central/west/south Harlem neighborhoods, on a budget and prefer not to have a roommate. However many sacrifices can be expected.  ",,,X,,,3,2,N,N,N,Studio,Less than 1 year ago,1-2 years,Front,3.90,4.17,A,99%,1

I have 11 foot ceilings, a wall of floor to ceiling windows, a large balcony, gorgeous oak floors, everything new.  Aesthetically it's more like living in Germany or the Netherlands than NYC.  I love the amenities - the gym has everything you need and is never crowded. The rooftop is like having access to a private park (except that it is open only from Memorial Day through Labor Day).  A friend of mine calls this a retirement community for millennials - there is definitely a sense of living in a big dorm for young adults. 
Management has always been super responsive to my requests, and although there were growing pains with mail and package deliveries at the beginning, management has smoothed out the process.
The building staff is great. I've never had an issue with the doormen, and the cleaning staff works very hard at keeping the place spotless.
Now the disadvantages: walls are thin so you can hear your neighbors. The layout of the apartments is not well planned - for example, my bedroom wall is next to my neighbor's living room, so I hear their TV, music, and conversations.  There is a constant smell of marihuana in the entire building, which is to be expected in this part of Brooklyn, but it can get annoying when it's inside your unit. Same for the smell of cooking: because there are no extractors in kitchens, many neighbors leave their door ajar while they cook, which fills the hallways with the smell of food.
The electric bill is the highest I have paid in 20 years of living in NYC. Each apartment has its own electric water heater, which adds to the expense. 
Finally, the units come without blinds or hardware for curtains, which were expensive to install given the large size of the windows.
This building is perfect for people in their 20s and 30s. If you are older and seek more peace and quiet, this is not the place for you.",X,X,X,,X,4,2,N,N,Y,1 bedroom,Currently live here,1-2 years,Southside,4.97,5.43,A,95%,5

1) Pot smoke will get into your apartment in 1 of 3 ways every day:  
a) through the water heater cabinet, which has a direct airway to the basement, where teenage kids smoke. This is the worst and it's equivalent to them blowing smoke in your face. Your air purifier indicator will be in red-colored warning mode the entire home and you'll go to the hallway for a breather.
b) Whenever someone smokes in the bathroom, it travels through all the bathrooms on all floors, which are stacked on top of each other
c) If neither of the previous two items occur, smoke will get into your window through the alley way, where people smoke.
2) The apartment gets super hot in winter. I would have windows open plus my A/C blowing, and I would sleep on my couch in the living room b/c it got too hot in the room.
3) There are roaches.

Spent 5 years living on the 3rd floor.

Pros: Spacious apartment, tons of storage opportunities, fairly quiet because it’s at the back of the building. Rent stabilized, never raised more than $25/month. They agreed to replace the small stove with a full sized unit upon move-in. Close to both subways, laundry a block and a half away. 

Cons: MANY. The super is terrible. His English is iffy, he rarely ever shows up on time, can’t trust him when you make appointments. He’s friendly enough (in a sexist “hey sweetheart” way) but grossly incompetent. I lost so much money taking off work for him to no-show for important repairs. Small roaches, off and on. No matter how clean the place was kept. Recently I sprayed for bugs (when contacted, the super’s guy just put bait out, didn’t bother spraying) and it lasted only 3 months before they came back in full force. The building doesn’t offer any regular extermination. Also, consistent water damage in the bathroom ceiling over 4 years time, always just spackled and painted. The issue upstairs clearly has never been truly resolved. 

Also, two buildings over there are constantly men on the stoop who are definitely “on lookout” at all times. They don’t mess with you when they know you’re local, but still something to consider.

I would say this is an okay spot to land for a year before moving on to better things. ",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,4.57,6.05,A,98%,1

The apts are very old and the upgrade is rejected by maintenance. The number one offset of this construction, I suppose, is that it is not smoke-free. And I'm talking about the ash tray, not smoke free. From the elevator to the hallways, the whole building reeks of stale 24/7 cigarette smoke. Over the past two years, I have sat next to a heavy chain smoker and the smoke filters from every outlet, funnel, fan, wall into my suit. Since I moved in in 2018, I have not closed the windows because it is the only way to flush out the smoke stink without clouding the whole apartment. As the Javitz center building has been underway since 1912, having the windows open 24/7 contributes to more suffering. Under the hours of service outlined in the construction plans, they DO NOT operate. Every morning, they arrive about 3-4 am and often continue straight through until midnight or 1 am. Especially lately, with the homeless population dramatically growing, the city is terrible. The facilities are an overpriced parking lot, a sun deck overlooking the bus terminal of the Port Authority, a few faulty treadmills, and a sauna. Management is undoubtedly friendly, which is good since tenants are some of the most rude and truly negative persons among them. Most of the time, I take the stairs to avoid being with someone living here. They do not handle or watch dogs or other animals, but all over the land there is regular piss and poop.

During the winter months all the cold air slips in through the windows not to mention dirt and leaves that slip through the cracks because these windows are not properly sealed and when you tell management if they can replace your windows because too much cold air comes through they say “all the apartments have that issue”. They do not provide any screens and they do not attempt to properly seal the windows. They won’t issue you any more screens even though tons of screens somehow end up in the garbage room. The heat in this building is also just ok because of the whole window issue so even if the heater is on blast because the windows are not properly sealed you will be cold. If you have a radiator in the room and are able to close the door then you have a better chance of staying warm up but if there’s no radiator in the room be prepared to bundle up while indoors. During the summer months the building gets HOT so definitely install an AC. There are 2 elevators and 2 ramps on both sides of the building so it is wheelchair accessible.

I wish I could give the management at Roosevelt Landings a derogatory star. It takes them forever to answer a call or a text. It's really disturbing and it's going to turn your entire world upside down. I was preparing to step out at the end of the year because of replacement jobs. So I called them to resolve the issue a few months ago. The mgmt office informs me that to take over my contract, I need to find a replacement otherwise I'll still have to pay the deposit. Then I asked for the requirement for pricing data and implementation so that I can advertise the apt. No reply arrived. I attempted to call the office and several times sent emails to follow up. Either they said the person responsible is on holiday or they are working on it and will get back to me, but then no response again. The same thing happened when I asked for a recommendation letter from the landlord for my new apt application. For a couple of weeks, I ordered it and followed up and followed up. They first said it takes at least 5 business days to process and they can't do anything but to order it by pressing a button in the system. Later, when I was eventually able to contact them by phone, they said that the only person who could sign the letter had 2 days of preparation and I would have to wait. And there was never any reply after that. I ended up having to postpone my move-out arrangement because I was unable to search for a replacement and was unable to apply for new apt, and in my life I had to reorganize things. Not to mention that they are so arrogant and so irritated with the administrators. Much of the time you contact them, they just don't pick up the phone and pretend they aren't in the workplace. They won't return emails either. They're just so frustrated that they can't even wait for you to finish your question and will just hang up if you dial enough times to actually get them to pick up the phone.

What is being announced to the city must be more than twice the occupancy. Rents are not, by no means, inexpensive. A $6K boundary with two bedrooms, which is around the hood's going pace. Management is normally compassionate, but rather unprofessional. Trash stacks up in the rear lobby until they clean it out and it fills up again until there is virtually NO space to walk by. They announce that they're a house for doormen. True, there's a person sitting at the front desk, but they hardly discourage people from getting into an elevator and doing anything they want. I even see people who Obviously do NOT live in the building creep into the gym. True, elevators often break down, and in the high commuting periods, there are lengthy wait times. In any of the public spaces, alcohol is not allowed because they sub-locate approximately 4 floors to the nearby Leman Prep School. So in the morning, there are still kids packing the elevators. The stairwells and corridors still smell of ammonia, tobacco, or cigarette smoke. Those tenants SMOKE A LOT and obviously Can NOT read the warning packets on their smoke sides!

You were handled basically as if you were living in a dorm, absolutely all is watched, not to mention the ridiculously bad actions of the guys working at the front desk and front entrance, walking after work every night was like walking into a party of Frat Initiation.

For most, life in this building was a total misery and will continue to be until something about the mgmt business and the guys working in this building is finished. 88 The only building affected by Sandy was not Greenwich.

There's also an explanation that they do have a good amount of units at this time available for sale. I was one of the ones getting out after the sandy one, and I'm happy I did.

Buyer/Renter Beware — while the unit we rented was newly renovated upon moving in with SS appliances there were many flaws in construction and management. The addition of a W/D in our unit made it such that our bathroom water would not get hot until running the tap or tub for 15 mins (and mind you we are paying for hot water). The drywall behind the shower walls were constructed poorly and within  4 months of living here, the new tiles fell off and had to be repaired! Several times the only elevator on our side or even water was out of service during difficult peak hours like smack midday. The  buzzer/doorbell/intercom system (tied to your phone number) has not worked since living here and when brought up to management, is addressed but then 2days later erased from the intercom system so I literally have over 30 emails complaining until we just stopped. This was unacceptable especially when everyone is relying on deliveries during Covid-19. The building is kept clean. That’s maybe one (+). ?? They do have a locker system for packages BUT they aren’t even used causing packages to be stolen bc they are left outside the lockers lol. The superintendent has changed 3-4x in just 2 years. I don’t  even know who he is but doesn’t  matter bc each time you reach out they are unresponsive. When you reach out to upper management they also take days to respond, if at all. There’s a fancy ticket request system for maintenance but they don’t respond but mark tickets as completed. We’ve been here 2 years and they still have not put child guards on the windows. I even told the city inspector and they still have not addressed this. There are roaches maybe coming from adjacent apartments. The floor above me sounds like they purposely drop barbells or move furniture every week- like WTF.  This neighborhood isn’t so friendly either- it’s full of closed minded non mask wearing unfriendly types of people. It’s loud at night with cars pumping weird music outside. As a young new mother, I was hoping to feel a sense of community here but felt more isolated and got weird stares maybe bc i’m a POC?

It's beautiful, tree-lined, quiet, and peaceful. A block away from either Myrtle or Dekalb where you can find a wealth of grocery stores, restaurants, cafes, laundromats, etc. 5 minute walk to Ft. Greene Park, and neighbors are friendly. The building itself has tons of windows so we got lots of natural light. Specific things I loved about the apartment are: the size of the rooms, generally much larger than a typical NYC apartment. Closet space - we had large closets in every room, multiple large closets in the communal areas, and a huge walk-in pantry! Nice roof-top view of Manhattan. Generally quiet and kind neighbors, it was a very peaceful place to live with plenty of space to unwind.

What I did not like about the building was the poor level of maintenance. There were always issues with plumbing of some kind, whether a pipe was leaking or water damage from the ceiling (rain or pipes? unclear). Repairs typically took a long time to address and would involve some form of simply duct taping or bandaging the problem temporarily (for example, one winter a window broke, and they simply taped plexiglass and cardboard over it until we complained again and threatened to withhold rent). Heat is provided by the building but most winters they rarely turned on, even if we had the valves open at full blast – so we got used to wearing coats indoors. The property management were never rude or cruel about these repairs, just lazy and cheap it seemed. I tolerated this as a sacrifice for the amount of space and the neighborhood but... it's important to keep this in mind, you may have a lot of maintenance issues and will have to chase management on a fairly regular basis. If this is something that doesn't bother you and you are willing to deal with that for the beauty of this space, then it is otherwise an incredible building. But if these maintenance issues will drive you crazy, you've been warned.",X,X,X,X,X,5,5,Y,Y,Y,4+ bedroom,Less than 1 year ago,5+ years,Front,4.54,5.56,A,99%,1

Pros & Cons: Doormen - but some very creepy. Elevators - but slow on a lot of days. Good mail sorting system - but doormen will buzz you if you leave your packages down there for too long (understandable!). Big rooms - but very thin walls. Laundry in basement - watch out for pests (also the super lives in the basement...). More details: This condominium building is right in the Kips Bay / Murray Hill area - a very nice, lively area, consisting of the Kips Bay AMC, Fairway, a plethora of bars/restaurants, and coffee shops, among other things. The units in this building are old - with only a few renovated throughout. Because this is a condominium, each unit has a different owner, so each tenant's experience will vary slightly. The building on a whole is decent - doormen, organized/safe mail delivery system, elevator, and laundry in the basement. If you keep your apartment unit clean, you won't see pests in there, but it isn't impossible - I try to keep my unit as clean as possible, and I've seen a handful of roaches (yes, the big kind). The building's super...is just ""okay"". He will help you out if you pester him enough - but if you get on his bad side, good luck. At one point after moving in, the building lost gas for 6 months - that means no oven, stovetop, or laundry. And no one (at least to my knowledge) was reimbursed for rent - which is just a less-than-desirable situation. I lived here for three years, but I'm glad I'm moving - although, for a first apartment in NYC, I won't call it bad at all.

Super courteous and responsible who does what he is expected to do and quick to respond. This is also where the drawbacks start: the apt was given to me in an offensively dirty state plus a flourishing roach colony in the kitchenette. The apt was given to me in an offensively dirty state. Wall-to-wall, I had to disinfect. In spite of the biweekly exterminator trips, neighbours talked about roaches and rats. At the door, you'd always experience a faint stink. Basically, architecture is old, broken down and needs restoration, well, even pre-war decoration. The landlady/manager has a friendship that is very upsetting. She threatened me that in my apt there was a suspected ""cat odor"" and that I should clean up before I leave - I didn't get that well remembering the condition in which I found it; and said enough. Her realtor brought buyers without advance warning at this period, who ultimately one day only placed a key in and opened the door to my morning coffee. Finally, while I waited in good conscience, she kept my deposit for 2 months to figure out a belligerently specified explanation for not having gotten a pre-stamped envelope. When I reminded her that she could pick up the phone and ask for one (why, by the way?), the reaction was because I had left certified mail with contact details. She doesn't have the smallest clue that she's representing you and you're a patron. Bottom line: With a disconnect between supply and demand, as in Manhattan, you spend $1600 a month for such market activity. Nonetheless, if you are clean and wise enough to keep the plague out and if you are robust enough to cope with an ill-tempered New Yorker, it is a livable and pretty space.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,4.18,5.69,A,96%,9

IF you find an apartment in this building that is completely renovated, then that may not be an issue. My kitchen was newly renovated before I moved in and the floor is perfectly fine in there. But the living room and bedroom? All messed up. Super is a bit hard to get in contact with. I feel like the poor guy has so many tenants to go to everyday he never has the time to deal with my issues unless it has to do with the plumbing. Which brings me to that issue, sometimes when they're working on someone's pipes, the water will just stay cold. No hot water. And they don't tell you about it. I'd love it if the building had a system in place for announcements or updates so I know when I can shower or not. They also haven't fixed two of the smoke detectors in the hallways, which end up beeping every five minutes. I'd say, check this place in person first.

The building is old, but well maintained - one of the building employees cleans all of the common spaces at least on a biweekly basis (I ended up seeing him far more than the live-in super, he was definitely a community-staple figure), and the tenants kept to themselves. Laundry in building and two elevators were both really convenient, and in case of an emergency the three staircases provided ample escape routes. Additionally, there were security cameras in both the atrium and lobby, so the only people that really ever frequented the building were residents and guests.

As far as the neighborhood goes, 244 W 72nd falls squarely within the UWS geographically, but feels a bit more transient – it falls right in the grey area between Lincoln Square and truly residential UWS, and sees a lot of traffic. The street runs two ways and connects Riverside Drive to Broadway/Amsterdam, so a couple of public bus routes pass through. In the apartment, I regularly heard the bus and car traffic from the street below, background noise from Henry Hudson Parkway, and a good number of emergency vehicle sirens (the fire station is on 66th, there are a couple of urgent care centers nearby, and the cross between Amsterdam and Broadway makes the area a common route for ambulances); but I was on a high enough floor that it really faded into the background. Personally, I thought a little bit of noise was a fine trade-off for the convenience – there are two grocery stores, two bars (neither of which were rowdy, but they did provide some late night foot traffic), a pet store and vet, a barber, two deli’s, and a couple barbers just on the block, and both Central Park and Riverside Park were just a couple blocks away. 

About the building itself – it’s old, so it has its quirks. The nicest quirk, I thought, was the thick walls… You really can’t hear the neighbors. The doors are heavy (metal reinforced for security), but hang a bit loosely in the frame so you can hear everything in the hallways (but not compromising security at all). The kitchen setup I had (full sized stove/oven, ¾ refrigerator, no dishwasher) was formatted as it was to hide holes in the walls. While the countertop went all the way back to the wall, the lower cabinets left about an inch of unaccounted wiggle room.  Although I’m the kind of person to keep all of my kitchen stuff in sealed containers, the one cockroach I encountered here definitely crawled in through that gap – I found it dead under my sink pipes. The stove didn’t have a ventilation system of any kind, so I’d often get my pans hot on the stove and open my window to actually sear my food over the fire escape (I never set off the smoke alarm, but there were a couple times I opened up my windows and blasted my A/C fan to clear the air). Steam heat was included in the apartment and is managed by the building, and fortunately they tend to run the building hot in the winter – I never found myself cold once winter really began, and on a cold fall day I could heat up the apartment simply by baking a loaf of bread or simmering a soup for an hour or two. Like the building, the pipes are old, and if they haven’t been turned on in a while, they spit out some rust/mildew for a second before running clear – I’d highly advise using a water filter for any drinking water. 

Overall, it’s a nice place to live! Pretty no-fuss living (at least by my standards), and while it comes at a high price, it had the right balance of livability and convenience that I needed while I lived there.

Granted, having the privilege of a doorman and laundry in the building is quite good, and I admit that the doorman and boss are both very good and very welcoming. The trouble with the house is that it is mostly ragged—even the table in the foyer is kept together on the sides with scotch tape—and the rugs also should be replaced. In addition, the place is HORRIBLE—I recently moved to the city and was ignorant of the enormous flood of garbage (in all respects) that comes every weekend across the street.

I was told that drug trafficking is on the rise, and saw a drunk man passing out in a corner surrounded by paramedics—just what you expect in a ""home"" town!

We have been living in this building for three months. The neighborhood is lovely, and the apartment itself is nice—although the appliances are the cheapest version they could get and tend to break down a lot.

Problems started still in the summer. The AC unit broke down, the incredibly nice building maintenance person did everything he could to fix the problem, but the unit needs replacement. We have been trying to get them to replace the unit for so long that Fall came, and now WE DO NOT HAVE HEAT, as it's a mixed AC/heat unit.

The management company simply ignores any communication by email or phone. I have gotten an attorney and will start withholding rent, and not providing heat is illegal per NY state law.

She’ll gaslight you; when the heat goes out, she’ll claim it’s a city-wide shortage on gas (which I believed once), and then she’ll cry because she has to pay for improvements. I had an entire winter with no heat and winters before with next to no heat. She’d send me messages about turning down the thermostat when I’d leave; I’d say something, she’d call saying she said that to all tenants and gaslight me when the temps were controlled through a central system (and she had the never to expect me to adjust the heat for other units when mine was broken).

Cons
- some apts have one room that’s very small without a closet which makes prorating rent challenging—if you can pay more this could be a home office instead of a bedroom
- heating and cooking are electric so utility bills are high

Typical security camera system. Delivery men or mail couriers will randomly ring all doorbells to be let in. No major security in place. Two major downside for me: AC installment and heater during the cooler months. In order to install an AC, you need to mail a written request and await for a return letter of approval. Once you are approved, you will need to have a licensed professional to install or pay $100 fee for maintenance to do it. The heaters are always on blast once the months get a little cooler.

PROS:
Large Apartment
Stainless Steel Appliances
Hardwood Floors
Great Light
Lovely Neighborhood
Laundry in building
Close to the train

CONS: 
Repairs take long
Outdated bathroom and kitchens (some apartments are updated but not all)
Near a busy road (think fire trucks and ambulances)
Restaurant/Club across the street (music until 1-2am on Fridays/Saturdays)

The noise is not always an issue but when it is I recommend earplugs.

The building has a nice, well kept front garden and original floors in the lobby. The majority of the apartments face 97th which is a very quiet street. Building was built in 1930's so my living room floor used to shake a little bit. Immaculate building, I never saw a little bug, even in the basement where the laundry place is located. If you're a new tenant, you'll probably get a renovated kitchen and/or bathroom since the landlord is interested in doing renovations when a tenant leaves, so the rent can be legally raised. Building is rent stabilized but the catch is the landlord gives a monthly discount over the legal rental price. The discount will decrease with every new lease you'll sign. That means your rent will go up even if the rent stabilized law mandates a O percent increase. I started with a discount of about 500 that almost evaporated in 5 years. Still no bad for NYC. 
Best thing is the location, everything is a two-minute walk away (supermarket, walgreens, Irish pub, great restaurants). A big park is two blocks away with astonishing views of the NYC Bay and the Verrazzano bridge. The shore park is a little further away, you can jog by the sea. Subway station is five minutes away.

Many perks of this rental building became unavailable and unaffordable. During Covid, a lot of the tenants have left the building including myself because unlike many of other nyc building owners who have shown mercy on tenants, Related remained the luxury cost as is and did not let the tenant break the lease - which was allowed precovid with a couple months notification.
Overall, my feedback is that big corporations like Related put money first before human. This is the reason why I recently left this “luxury” condo.

For the past 8 months, I have been loving the area, the cost and the facilities. But a tragic accident occurred today, which made me have to offer a one-star review. You may think I'm exaggerating, but please read: The whole planet is in a condition like COVID-19. New York City is the most seriously impacted of all the cities in the US. There are a total of 904,581 diagnosed cases in America until 4/24/2020 and the figure is already climbing. You can also see videos from Youtube and several shops on the Google homepage that advise people to stay at home and wear a mask to help avoid the coronavirus. About 1:20 PM on 4/24/2020. After I did some grocery shopping, I went to the MP10 doorman to pick up a box, so I was wearing a mask. 'Hi, may I pick up a box, please? Please, apt 10J, thank you.' He said I had to lift my voice, he couldn't hear me, which is totally OK. Then I lifted my voice and echoed it. But please remember, there's an OK line between shouting at people and making yourself clear to people. I'm an Asian lady, too, but I don't have a penetrating voice. The doorman shoved a bag with the 8J label at me. Then I said, 'Excuse me, sir, thank you, but this isn't mine, my apt 10J, please,' Then the most confounding and improper thing happened: he began screaming at me, 'I——————- '-that's funny, if he didn't notice me, then would he know that there is a J in my apt number? Then he said,' Can't you just take off your mask? What are you hiding behind that glass (a isolation glass designed by the mgmt for the reception, which is good)? YOU ARE BEHIND THAT———-GLASS, JUST TAKE YOUR MASK OFF and OPEN YOUR FREAKING MOUTH. YOU GET THE——-OUT OF HERE 'if you don't know how to. I was surprised, and I explained it to him then. These days, everybody wears a mask first of all, it's not against a particular person and it's promoted by the CDC and the government. In comparison, wearing a mask is reciprocal security, it is genuinely responsible for me and those around me. It's not a way for me to show any hint of disrespect. ""More shocking things happened, he rolled his eyes, and he kept screaming, ""You're now being mean. When YOU don't take your mask off and speak to me properly. I'm not going to give you your kit. You'll need to come here. GET OUT OF MY FACE.' I then asked,' Why should I come back for parcels, please, when it's here? And I CAN. I CAN MAKE YOU COME BACK AS MANY TIMES AS I WANNA. I CAN MAKE YOU BACK AS MANY TIMES AS I Want. YOU—————- CHINESE———. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE YOUR MASK OFF AND HOW TO Talk, YOU RUDE——— 'I was absolutely stunned and couldn't believe what was going on right in front of me. I said, please and thank you all the time, because this is a CHINESE/ASIAN HATE CRIME and CORONAVIRUS HATE CRIME, which I couldn't believe happens in New York City. It's so amazing that whether you wear a mask, with too many locations denied service or admission. And many people and their families losing their lives. For all these nurses and physicians working to defend us from COVID-19 at the cost of their lives. This house, this place I live and walk around every day, would have asked me to take off my mask. This is not inhumane and tolerable. He even waved his hands, I think if there was no video camera he had every intention of attacking me. I've never met in person with this doorman before, so it's not a personal matter. At the leasing agency, I left a voice mail and have not heard back so far. The doorman is still sitting in the MP10.0 lounge at the moment. Please find out if anybody knows his name. I would like to directly file a lawsuit with the city and the government. Please find out if you have any money. I can be reached by calling . I assume this will be looked at by mgmt. Hey, thank you.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,Currently Living,,,4.95,9.18,A,88%,12

Here's my evaluation of the pro & cons: PROS: I was in a studio on the first level, so it gets a lot of light, which is nice. It's in the back of the house, so it's shielded from much of the street noise. It's very quiet. There's a really nice shot of the skyline, too. Often, living on the first floor meant that there was no occupant above me to stumble through. Unfortunately, as I learned later, the occupant next to you can make much more noise than a person above you. The stairwells and garbage were well kept, and the dry tidier next door was always generous enough to take deliveries (even though the tenants were not using their service, which I felt was extremely gracious to them, and a little presumptuous to the residents who would often knock ""Deliver to dry tidiers!"" on the front door of the house, as if the tiger were an Amazon locker). Mgmt Company: I thought things were going pretty well. For the last five years, I haven't had very much contact with them. I came out of the place in fine shape and got my maximum security deposit back. However, the lady in charge of the lease extension department is rather prickly. I've had to negotiate with her a couple of times. One year, I called and politely asked her a question about the extension of my lease. She was very impatient and practically scolded me for not understanding that my particular unit was not available for rent stabilization, even though the building was rent-stabilized. Also, at the end of my tenancy, when I called the office to say I wasn't renewing, the leasing agent, Ava, was very blunt and nasty in her email address back to me, which I considered unusual, since I still paid my rent on time and never caused anybody any trouble. CONS: It's a significant one. The walls dividing the studios are very low. I didn't know this in my first four years, because the lady next to me was super silent. She probably had a lot of carpets to dampen the noise, too. But a new occupant moved in (a younger guy) during my last year, and all of a sudden I could hear: phone calls, conversations, TV, music, microwave, sneezes, etc., so obviously it was like he was in my house. He still had a habit of cranking his TV at 1 a.m., but after I spoke to him about it, he was good enough to solve it, which I enjoyed. Unfortunately, he was the heaviest walker on the planet, too. Like, oddly heavy-footed. Any time he walked through his house, my whole place would quake (bed, sofa, desk). It felt like an earthquake was going on. He was a decent person, but I wasn't going to challenge him to walk lighter, but I never got used to that. I bumped into his neighbor downstairs before I left, and she said it was nuts in her unit, too. The only other thing is that the top floor spaces are really HOT. In the top floor studio, there's no cross wind. From May to October, I had to work my A/C pretty much. All in all, I found it to be a nice house, clean, and well restored at a discount.

I will stop it, though, Mostly because it's on-site 'mgmt.' Previous comments have noted 'expectations are low and unethical' - not my apt that the water broke after a water main break in the house, however a neighbor flooded my apt causing major damage that 'Nicole assured me the company will pay all costs' - converted into the insurance of your renter could cover it. Nevertheless, the damage arising from outside contractors they employed to fix the damage, clean and rebuild warped water affected flooring, base boards, walls where the water soaked up 3 'up, moisture damage, warped doors, delaminating cabinets - it also took more than 3 weeks to repair and 6 months later I still didn't have anything fixed - I called five times and had it tested four times, but the cabinets were still not repaired. In addition they have misplaced my rug 10' x 14' cause it has been 5 months later and it stil has not been restored. They called me again to search the cabinets that I told them to look at your notes so I'm not going to make you come to see again what the problem is. I even had to argue with the building that they just decided to patch the floor with a new wood stain because pieces were not badly affected! Did anyone ever hear that this was being done? Damage that happened after the crash - all my plants were destroyed by the humidifier they had going for 2 weeks, caused the animal heads I have to break and blister, took possession of my herman miller antique couches, a new tv frame made of custom wood carvings ($1,000) just bought for a customer with the receipt from a month ago -I transferred it myself, along with my calvin klein bed and room and board credenza, to a place they declared safe cause I did not want them hurt. I later found that the antique sofa was thrown and scratched up - this is based on the video evidence from the elevator that it was tossed or taken by the builders they employed, the credenza was scratched up, the concrete planters all shattered from the exposure to humidity, the bed was poorly reinstalled and caused the leg to break off and the metal frame to warp. NICOLE came up and told me they were going to resolve it - she was trying to get the management to fix it. But she was advised that it couldn't be solved, only to forget the problem now. There was more than $8,000 in damage on all the things - they gave me $1,500. On the auction site, the antique sofa alone was $6,000 because it is vintage. When I went to ask them to repair it, she said the value was diminished because it was antique - it was retro and actually packaged and locked because I saved it - they opened it when it was found in the garbage and the beams were all patched up from their treatment of it, as seen in the video of the elevator. In addition, my shelving unit was destroyed and the marble counter on it was also broken. There were also many other items that were damaged, such as antique hand etched champagne flutes. I am now proceeding with legal action at this stage when I find out that with some former tenants that I have now reached out to, this has happened. The water pipe burst in one instance that may have scalded a newborn infant - the building did not admit blame and instead said they would patch the furniture that was broken but not compensate for it. Insterad told me to explain the list that I broke down into two lists - One I filed with landlords for damage arising from the next door water break and the other a list of things they lost during the repairs from the work of their contractor and neglect to my house. My renter's insurance covered the former loss with a premium that is not even covered by their compensation of $1,000. I haven't got a cent from AVALON - Beware to date. I have evidence from other residents who moved in and checked if there were bed bugs in their penthouse unit because they had bite marks - the building said no. There are numerous other complaints with the building. Yet otherwise, public documents show that I will not believe building mgmt with anything they say going forward - I also called out and found the real estate agent who told me this. Since finding out the building knew and lied about it, the occupant ended up moving out. At this point, when Nicole told me that construction will not pay for the damage but for 15 percent of the real damage, I will continue with legal recourse. She told me to do what I wanted to do. Read past comments; don't believe or trust any remarks from her. This definitely isn't a landlord's action of honesty. If you wish to reach out, I will supply documentation of these activities to validate this analysis. Proceed with caution.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,3-4 years,,4.47,4.67,A,100%,11

The building has a lot of pros and cons. Most of the appliances are decent and the market rent tenants get better quality apartments and service. The low income ones get the used appliances and poor service. The laundry room is equipped with modern technology and functional; it use to be 24/7 now it’s only until 10pm very inconvenient for people who work weird shifts and have open availability on the night. The building has 4 elevators which tend to work on and off. Majority of the time only 2 work. Security guards are fairly lazy and not much of help. The maintenance workers are terrible and have poor repair skills. The management changes every other year due to the high demand in responsibility, being unable to meet expectations and the pressures of having to deal with multiple people and problems. The apartments are okay, it’s more so what you make of it. The neighbors depends on the floor you are on. There’s a lot of ghetto tenants as well as well mannered, clean, and mind their business.

Only complaints I would note are: 1- Most people do not know that stabilization (i.e. what the city sets) is focused on ""legal allowable"" (i.e. $13k for a 1 bed @ 88Leonard) vs ""preferential rate"" (i.e., aka ""market rate"" for a 1bed that is 4700). So they wanted to hike us 2.5 percent above the $13k figure vs. what we were paying before renewal arrived. (IMO) when pitching potential tenants, this is obviously 'overlooked'. Laws are rules, and I understand that this is bad form and a little sly in my way - just not being completely open about it (and many apparently according to refund tenants received in 2019). 2. Rose takes an attitude to 88 Leonard that is really 'cat friendly.' That's perfect. Only be conscious that 200 yards on either side of your home entrance can stink like a piss pot (especially in summer). 3- smoking, as noted in some other comments. Of course, individuals will smoke regardless of 'rules' in their apts—but you will catch drifts of it in your spot. There is mediocre compliance. Again - very good/tidy construction with outstanding management/roof-deck/apts - but worth mentioning the above 3.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,Currently Living,,,4.96,3.06,A,99%,12

ESPECIALLY FROM APARTMENT 6A!!!!! The building itself is beyond unsanitary, and we barely made it through our 6 months there. The laundry and trash are located in a filthy, smelly dungeon of a basement. The building reeks of cigarettes, trash, and is poorly maintained and the musky air will make you feel sick. There are clearly issues with the building’s heat and cooling systems that either the owners or the building management are too cheap to properly fix, costing the residents hundreds in energy bills. Our real issue with the building was the particular apartment we lived in - apartment 6A, owned by Jennifer Zeng, MD which will be advertised as a 1 bedroom when in actuality is a dump of a studio apartment with an illegal wall put up - we got the building department to confirm this. The floorboards and appliances are installed crooked and uneven - leaving room for dust, filth, and debris to pile up in and around the floorboards that will make you feel as if your camping out on the street, rather than living in a Manhattan condo. When we moved in just in the midst of the COVID we were horrified at the apartment’s deplorable condition. We weren’t allowed to view the apartment due to COVID, and Jennifer’s real estate agent Beth Levy (Compass Reality) lied that it was a beautifully renovated apartment when in actuality, she never even went to look at it. Over 3 different colors of paint splotched on the walls and ceiling, mold and mildew built up in the shower, mold under the non-functioning AC unit that was promised in the lease but the landlord refused to replace, a broken dishwasher that was also promised in the lease but took the landlord 3 months to replace, food on the floor, a sticky fridge that took me days to clean, clumps of dust built up everywhere, and hair everywhere. Light fixtures improperly jammed into the ceiling, broken ventilation systems in the kitchen and bathroom - it was heath hazard after health hazard. The landlord is a crook who should have her rental license revoked for the way she keeps this apartment, and the same goes for her crooked real estate agent who charged us one month’s rent thinking she was doing us a favor, and never even thought to refund us despite how she lied to us about the apartment’s condition. When we brought these issues to the landlord’s attention, her solution was telling us to “leave”, after we just paid a full months rent, one month’s security, one month’s rent of a broker fee, plus a $400 non-refundable fee to the condo board (this slum shouldn’t even be allowed to call itself a condo), plus a $500 move-in security deposit, plus thousands in movers since we moved state-to-state. She wasn’t willing to refund us for nearly any of it, so we tried to stick it out. It took the landlord 3 months to replace the dishwasher that was broken upon our move-in. This left us to hand-wash piles of dishes every night in 95 degree heat since she wouldn’t replace the air conditioning, and we were eating every meal in due to COVID concerns. We even bought a thermostat to prove how hot it was, despite having the air conditioning as cold as possible, but she still refused to replace it. We even looked into replacing it and paying for it ourselves because the heat was so unbearable and we could barely sleep through the night. Upon trying to replace it, we learned she built the entire bedroom closet structure and the window structure around the air conditioning - so to replace the air conditioning all of that would need to be replaced as well. The unbearable heat carried into the winter and never seemed to end, also the worst part of all...our CON ED bills were upwards of $400-$500 a MONTH!!! FOR A STUDIO APARTMENT !!! One day, I entered the meter room in the basement and found that every meter was a smart meter except for our apartment. When we asked the super about this, he told us there was an issue with the wiring to 6A, so they didn’t bother replacing it. The Con Ed bills proved to be a scam when we got nearly a $500 bill in January when we essentially never lived there the entire month. The final straw for us was when the super allowed a plumber to ILLEGALLY ENTER OUR UNIT WITHOUT PERMISSION AND COMPLETELY UNSUPERVISED. A week later they added a riser into the 4’x7’ bathroom which makes it around 85 degrees, or hotter in there. When you shower, you’ll barely be able to breathe amidst the unbearable heat and all the dust piled in the vent. My fiancé also burnt his arm badly because they never bothered to put a protector on the riser. The pictures this slumlord uses to advertise are from 8 years ago. She won’t let you see it in person because she doesn’t want you to know how horrible it really looks, smells, and feels. Save yourself from congestion, constantly feeling sick, the unbearable heat, the $500/month electric bills, and run from this listing as fast as you can. Please contact me for photo and video evidence as I want to make sure no one ever has to go through what my fiancé and I went through. ",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,3.37,3.71,A,100%,2

There is no insulation throughout the building. There were no seals on the windows or A/C units meaning the cold and any noise from the outside would flow right through. The second bedroom in our apartment consistently smelled like pot from our neighbor's smoking.  Management did nothing to resolve any of these issues. We could hear every step of our upstairs neighbors and every time music was played at any surrounding apartment - this is usual in buildings of that age, but seemed much more pronounced in this building - probably due to poor insulation. At lease renewal, the management company did not provide renewal documents until 1 week before the expiration of the lease despite numerous phone-calls from us to have them sent. After sending them they required a response within 2 days. The water was out numerous times during our stay (often without advance warning). That was presumably done to resolve the extremely loud banging of the radiators (it would wake us up at night) but of course that wasn't fixed either. Generally, the management's approach was one of making everything the resident's problem. After we moved out, a few items were left behind by the movers which the Super decided to throw away without any notice to us.

You're never going to encounter glitches, the repair needs are handled quickly and the management is extremely helpful. However, I am NOT recommending it to anybody because of the general decisions of mgmt about this house. I lived here three years ago. My roommate spent six years in this house. The rent rose by around 2.5% in my first year. Equal and comprehensible. We signed a 2-year contract the next year that increased our rent by close to 8 percent. Our rent was increased by 18 percent this year! The justification given to us was that our suitability for Manhattan requirements was far below market value. It is well known that the New York real estate scene is a borderline crime scene. With the supers/landlords, the brokers are in bed and they are all in bed with the New York justice system. I have experienced blatant bigotry in my four and a half years in New York, landlords tricking their rent stabilized tenants into getting booted out of their apts so that they can re-establish a higher rent and rent rises in stabilized non-rented buildings that are impressively disrespectful to long-term tenants who expected their reputation and patronage to a mgmt business could yeild a certain one This year's justification was that it was not renting this building at its market value. As a landlord, market value is a simple word to throw around, especially in New York City. But with a terrible economy, a mortgage shortage bordering the real estate scene on a total catastrophe and a severely shrinking employment market, are we supposed to accept that a one-bedroom (converted to house two people) is actually worth $600 more than it has been renting in the last two years? Yeah, Manhattan is an extremely populous city and one that holds some of the world's richest residents, but it's extraordinary to see an 18 percent rent rise. This will be downright unconstitutional in most states, and I encourage potential tenants to realize now that long-term tenants are not loyal. If they will kick you out, they can and there is no cap on whether the rent will go up each year. In non-rent subsidized apartments, the New York Housing Commission does not cover residents and this is one of them. It WAS a decent building and the good news is that I was planning on leaving irregardless of the rent hike (my job was taking me to the other coast). Still, I needed to seriously warn new residents that this building's mgmt business is sucking pretty hard on Greed's teat. Ouple that with it is utter and humiliating to sell out to the people at B&H and you will now find yourself waking up every morning to the management of B&H and their countless building jobs that will take place just outside your window for a 2700 dollar, 450 square foot apt.

You have access to the R and 7/LIRR stations and all are within 10-15 minute walking distance. As you walk through the area there are some quiet/eerie/lonely moments from the train stations due to the garages, car dealership, and autoparts businesses in the area.  It is also close to a mini shopping mall, Best Buy, Home Depot, Old Navy, and a large grocery store on Northern Blvd.  You have access to many restaurants, diners, and cafes including a Post Office and the Salvation Army near the LIRR/7 train station.  There are at least two organic mini grocery stores.  Cabs are in excess when you exit the LIRR/7 train station on a late night.  The front of the house is clean and well kept.  There wasn't any noise pollution in the neighborhood or from the tenants. If you are bothered by the noise from the planes passing by frequently, do not move here. You barely hear the planes pass with the windows closed. The size of the apartments on the top floor was on the small side but very cozy for 1-2 people.  What you miss in size you gain in storage space. The first and second floor apartments are much larger and the renovations were very nice. We had a pleasant landlord until it was switched to the son-in-law. We had mice on occasion, water bugs appeared after a rainfall, and centipedes would appear in the summer. The landlord did not fumigate the house for some time but finally did after a couple of years. If the landlord is keeping up with the fumigation -- awesome!

So they sell the building because they can't deal with the brigade (btw 99% of the neighbors are really nice. They are a cast of characters...but welcome to New York). The management company when I left is hard to get in touch with and the specific manager kept changing.

I've been living here for three years and I'm now going - thank god. I'm going to honestly confess that laziness was the reason I lasted as long as I was here. I hate traveling and while I hated staying here, I reluctantly renewed my lease b/c it was close to my office and I was too lazy to pack. I'm like other people. Now, to the point of disdain, why I don't like staying here: 1. Brodsky mgmt may be less concerned about you and can fuck you any minute they can. I found that smaller, renovated units were selling for less and having a month off contract, and my lease was up for renewal. I asked if I should get a similar offer and was simply told ""tough luck"" as though I was a great tenant (paid my rent on time every month and was quiet and considerate). While equivalent rentals were $200 cheaper, they gave a measly $50 deduction. Uh, yeah., oh., The representative of the office is nasty, unprofessional and wants to practice certain forms (my 5 year niece knows more about etiquette than her). Recently, the other office rep ——— quit. According to the older tenants, while I rarely dealt with her, she was dreadful and a party was actually thrown b / c of her departure. Yikes that this is who leaves brodsky org for tenants to deal with. 2. Worms, paint, mold and elevators - bad maintenance. I know tenants of both buildings and there is a rampant roach epidemic here. With old carpets and peeling paint, the hallways are dusty. The elevators are always having trouble, and due to expenses, mgmt is very reluctant to repair the problems. Like the laundry room and the ""gym"", the old carpets contain mold. The latter is a tiny, pitiful, unventilated space with old appliances (which is why membership is so cheap). Yeah, and with my floor and others, the stink of marijuana all the time. 3. Luxury, my ass. Yes, beaux arts is a building for doormen, and in the lobbies the art deco decor is fine, but go to the real floors and units. And it's garbage and untidy. I never seen better walk-up building interiors. In the units, no a/c. You have to order it and have it mounted properly, if you want a/c. In the studios and Junior 1s, kitchenettes (with mini fridges and no counter space) are quite pathetic and incomplete. My 2-cents: go to a goodr, better managed and tidyer construction with all the offers that are available. Although every mgmt building is going to try to fuck you up, this is the worst I've been dealing with in my 15 years in Manhattan (which translates into 7 different property managers).

On 78th Street, the apartments face on to John Jay park with children's playground, free racketball & squash courts, plus a free open-air Olympic size swimming pool and dive pool open in the summer months.

I couldn't say this enough, remain as far away from this building and every building that UDR runs as you can. Since they took over, it was like riding a crazy horse to a burning stable. Temp, noise, temperature, literally any problem or issue you have is swept away because being a resident doesn't mean anything to them, you're replaceable. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, the house was condemned and held to be non-livable for three weeks in November, at which time they wanted to charge everyone a full month's rent. A more recent example is the deal they've made with Kings College to house their students in our building, yes, you've read that correctly Approximately 20 1 bedroom apts are now dormitories holding 4 college students in each and every bit as disrespectful, noisy, and damaging as college students who live in a luxurious apt that mommy and daddy pay for as you can imagine. Not helped by the fact that the walls of this house are thin paper because you're still in the loop. That's not limited to 10 Hanover, by the way, UDR does so at a couple of their sites. I'd like to take a minute to chat about the ""amenities"" before I finish this study. The rooftop is about 40 square metres, lined with obnoxious drunk underage college men, and reeks of fuel. Subtract the diesel and you've got the 5th floor dining lounge. Would you want to try out? Good luck, we're the only luxurious downtown building that doesn't have its own gym, and the gym prices in the same building are scandalous. . The thought of having to go through a transfer combined with the fact that we love doorman/maintenance management is the only thing that has kept us here for so long, but college kids are a deal breaker.

It's not the building, it's the administration of the building. If you find this building irresistible as sales people show you an apt ready for rent, you're not alone. I saw it, and I had to drive straight away. I did not hesitate to see too many rentals in this cost category that were not half as good from the view of prospective tenants (meaning you judge entirely upon outside value). The apt I rented had beautiful views, a large but poorly built terrace, a mini w/d in the unit, and everything it lacked, which was nothing according to the sales manager, ""could be added no issue"" and I would have no trouble staying at 150 E. 57th Street as long as I was ""responsible"" and ""reasonable."" I lived there in the year I was there. Didn't have dinner guests (in fact, I've never cooked dinner once for myself because the refrigerator they installed after renovation doesn't fit into a tiny hole cut out for it and they won't replace anything even if you ask for an old, defective one in the basement), I've never had more than two guests in my apt, I've never played music, I've never even worked on video. I didn't do anything except sleep there and try to move in for a year. I should never have. They keep the keys to your apt and go inside periodically to search your paint colours, your blinds, everything. In fact, I found that when I looked at the apt, the doorman wasn't excessively charming or enthusiast, and I saw that nobody came across as especially pleased. But, before I lived there, I could never have understood the truth. The superintendent bullies the doorman, a pair report to him on the radio as you come and go, and he contacts Rose's boss and associates regularly with grievances that are either totally fictitious or highly inflated because he is so deeply jealous of the residents. After Almond emails, you get voice calls, emails, and written letters about the ""house rules"" that you have broken. Of course, until now, you haven't been made aware of any ""house rules"" You didn't realize that you violated the rules requiring flowers to be delivered after 4:30 p.m., but you violated the rules of your home. Your flowers have returned to the florist or will be kept in the luggage carts for the weekend before the next Monday's delivery day. And, there's nothing you can do. You can write countless letters of concern to mgmt, but it won't help you. Your washer and dryer will spill, the shower door will hang from the frame, the power will go out because you can't plug in the terrace heater because the MBR lights are on, the A/C won't be cool in the summer, and there's nothing you can do with it. You can't get to the super Scott Almond, who lives in the house, because the doorman is too terrified to call him before 9 a.m. and after 4 p.m. on the weekdays, because you'd rather go without power, ventilation, air, dry floor, and a healthy shower than making him mad. As the new doorman starts, they call and learn not to do so in the future. Each of them needs a hand out for anything, including a hello, and if you don't pay him off when you get in and out of the house, you're going to have to hire some help to bring in your heavy planters if the hurricane arrives. These two men, the doorman **** and the super Scott, Regularly tag team tenants, spy on your comings and goings, make new laws, deny service, and bring ****, their groupie porter, to your apt to find some unapproved photo to be recorded. And, you'll find out when you get the message about your misconduct via mail, audio, and email it it goes to your file so that 3 months before the expiration of your contract, someone can compel you to leave with a 30 per cent rise in rent. The internal power system makes the normative trade of NYC $20 for a wave sound noble. If you have to see for yourself, the one thing I would suggest is to carry your puppies. Then the cleaner crowds the laundry room and takes your stuff whilst the end-cycle bell is already buzzing, you don't have any rights. Be there to protect them or live with them. They've got them on tape, they're going to search the tape, and find nothing wrong but you. It looks fine, everything about the building looks good, but it's ""house rules"" meaning it's a little public laundry room. After all, what the heck do they owe you, right? I don't worry that much about the doorman or superintendent calling me over the walkie talkie while I'm in the ear shot. There's always plausible denial. I only wanted to live in shallow peace and protection with air, ventilation, energy, and a washer and dryer that I've been renting for a year. So this is my own view, hope yours is stronger.

Not only was it well run, the workers were extremely attentive and your requests or complaints were often answered to by the resident manager. This is NOT the case anymore and I sure would NOT suggest this complex. Property/Maintenance is now simply kept to a bare minimum of tidyliness, i.e. on weekends on holidays the garbage rooms are only cleared once a day and less than that. This implies it's overflowing—these are large floors and most tenants have kids, so the diaper and formula Amazon boxes are a massive trash room problem. Tenants... a big change. This is a really noisy family building today. Since there are still two strollers in it, you can't get on the elevators. In the hallways, the kids play and mgmt does not seem to think this is a concern. Roofdeck—take a close look at the cushions and the furniture. With smoke holes, the cushions are charred and are so filthy you can never lie on them. The wood dividers and the wood decking are broken by the kids who play with their toys here and make a big mess. The maintenance team works so tirelessly (they are the most awesome individuals and are genuinely committed to continuing to clean up this place), but it needs to be updated. And in any of the common places, there is NO WIRELESS despite the fact that mgmt tries to tell prospects that there is. Mngt - NOT responding to any emails, etc. You have to go to the office, and then they clearly tell you that they can't do something. The good jobs have resigned.

The house itself is very fine and well run, but the cost is inadequate for the apts.

I heard neighbors in the hallway, doors closing so loudly that it woke me up, a neighbour holding a weekly party, blowing up his music. When midnight struck, I always muttered. And if more than one person complains would the front desk do something. There's even a tenant in the cellar of the house and they're a gym for body building. This was never known to me and I had to figure out how hard the noise carried me to my floor through the garage, lobby and club stage. I had to listen to the weights slamming into the pavement every day, feeling like I was standing over a bowling alley. The noise was so loud that my guests and I were frequently shocked by it. One evening, a doorman came and confirmed that the disturbance was emanating from the occupant in the basement. Most evenings this went on long past midnight and most mornings ended at 6:00am. Mgmt did nothing to assist, but I didn't have the time to combat the war. I didn't build this dilemma, but I felt like I did with mgmt and the leasing office. This is not right. I listened to some of my neighbors and they heard the noise every day, too. No one should spend too much money to expect anything like this to be dealt with. I knew, too, that a sex abuser lived in the house. I was very curious about a park and a school very close to me. I tested the register in NY and this was actually valid. It was not very fun to deal with the leasing office and I recommend a tenant to get it all written.

The vents do not necessarily steam in the kitchen and bathroom, they serve rather like conduits of horrible odors (along with other as yet unknown pathways).

The super is attentive and supportive and things are held in working order (and if anything doesn't work for any cause, there will normally be a sign in the lobby about it indicating where it will be backed up).

now the bad, its small. so small. bedrooms can barely fit a bed. one of the rooms closet is a joke. the other two rooms have decent small closets. its super noisy if you face the street. the countertop got destroyed its made of cheap material. the walls were never painted just primed and absorbed dust and dirt and looked dingy. the shower leaks onto the floor creating a pool no matter what you do to try to stop it due to the crap glass shower door. it has a rooftop that was never finished so it was unusable when it was sold to us with the impression that it would be ready to use by spring time. a whole year and a half passed and NOTHING was done. its a walk up. narrow narrow hallways cant fit large furniture. our neighbors had to donate their couch because they couldn't get it in the hallway. the washing machine in the basement eats your money! it is nice tho that they have extra storage downstairs for us! but the smell of the sandwich shop comes thru the building and it STINKS! its impossible to get a hold of management or anyone to help with any issues at all whatsoever. and when you do they are very rude and dont respond in a timely manner. it took almost six months to get my deposit back. the owners are jews so forget it if you have an issue during a holiday or even a weekend (and they have a lot of hollidays). oh and finaly its redicuulously OVERPRICED. the only good thing is that its close to trader joes and the train isnt too far. our neighbors toilet did leak and stopped working. pretty much all our neighbors had huge issues with this apartment and management it wasnt just us being complicated.

Many of the negatives come down to a matter of taste or choice. For eg, the 'A' line has the complete length and width of the living room from floor to roof windows (in a 1BR that has not been partitioned). You've got at least a partial or better view of the BOTH rivers down 42nd Street, and the Liberty Statue above the 39th floor or so. However, much of the sky is obscured by the Times Square towers, but the northern views on the E, F, and G line give you a glimpse of the sky and the GW Bridge. In every other home, the bathrooms have something I haven't seen - an extra large bathtub, and almost double the square feet of most bathrooms, plus a linen cabinet. But there are no stainless steel appliances in the kitchen, and the dishwasher seems to be marginally shorter (stemmed glassware does not fit upright on the top rack specified by the others I had). A nice, well-equipped gym and laundry are mentioned in other comments. Here, laundry is as cheap as any building that I have lived in at $2 a wash. There were a number of complaints with the system, but in Feb 2012, the corporation that owns the equipment to replace Both washers and dryers was actually receptive to building mgmt. (A true temperature can still not be chosen, only a fabric/color setting, but it is a vast improvement.) There was still a ghastly selection made for the cardio devices, but the cardio machines were also replaced by mgmt in Jan 2012. It is difficult to program the selected brand, but they are new, while the other Nautilus-style machines are in fantastic shape. The stereo that certain residents were less than tolerant of using was also removed - now each cardio unit has an iPhone dock and TV headphone inputs. The tough thing about operating a New York building is that listening to all the demands that come in is a challenge. The handymen were always prompt to respond to repair applications, while I was lucky to have very few things to apply. The front desk has a video intercom so that you can see customers and delivery people as the concierge calls - every 5-8 months it appears to be out of static power, but within 3 days it has always been repaired. One of my main drawbacks are that without blinds, all apts come (so the tenant can select something they like). Getting custom shades made can cost $300-$500, or you can buy a package from another resident who is moving out; it may be hard to mount, but someone may be able to do it for $100-$140 (trust me-worth it's it!). Surprisingly, I had to use a lot of heat or a / c. The triple-glass windows support a lot better than my last two apt windows did, and the only silent ones I've had are the wall units that aren't central air. Even if they look the same size, the living room unit is more efficient than the bedroom unit. In contrast to other buildings in the city, rent is undoubtedly high in the house, but not outrageous. And it's worth it, with the small amount of problems I've had. For me, the main negatives are the absence of an open view, the absence of stainless steel equipment, and the noisy stroll through Midtown to work - none of which are construction challenges or mgmt itself. I have also planned to use a free month of rent to actually pay the 'net efficient' rate, but the mgmt company is a small, private company that doesn't take credit cards (few do, but when they do it's good!) and doesn't have the sort of accounting structure they would run a credit balance. It sounds strange when you remember that the legal rent on the property is $1,200-$1,500 more than the rent charged and that an annual discount is measured as a promotional rent. That's the same thing in all 4 buildings I've lived in for the past 8 years. It seems calm to the neighbors, but more impersonal than the other buildings I've been to. Any commercial services are also open, so the building can have a temporary look. On top of that, a lot of people appear to be renting their accommodation to European tourists - much to the surprise of the tourists that they are in an appropriate rather than a boutique hotel. I guess mgmt and the leasing office have been trying to break this down, so it ensures that you will be able to learn your Italian, Portuguese, German or [insert language here]. And I can't say enough about the friendliness of 80% of the management, particularly the doorman in the morning, who really helps put me in a better mood than I would otherwise be in. And they still know me and remind me, even with 400 tenants, when a delivery has arrived and usually welcome me by name when I come home. There might be a difference between staying on the 43rd in the low-rise and the 42nd in the high-rise, so investigate what fits for you all. I just feel amazing coming home to this place. Good luck, but it's a pricey house, so make sure it has the best balance of utilities and features for your taste that are important to you. Be also on the lookout for partitioned 1BRs where you miss too much of the convenience that the apts will offer. But recognize that in a rental property in frenetic New York, the building tries harder than any I have lived in to construct the best home experience possible.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,3.11,5.75,B,98%,11

(During the height of the Covid 19 in New York City). REQUESTED $3900 for 1 Apartment. I also given $2,900. Kathryn Peters (Leasing Manager) answered back that 'YES IS STEEP' but it was possible to accept and she will have fwd to the mgmt. (She immediately set up clearance for me to see the unit on my own.) I submitted an invoice of $20 with all the paperwork and wait until ONE WEEK passes by. Eventually, 9 days after I submitted an application, I got the 'APPROVAL' e-mail and demanded an appointment. I was angry not only that I had been waiting for an answer for a week, but I had taken a credit hit for their investigation into my bid, which was not based on MY OFFER I was forced through hoops and almost fooled into signing a lease for a better sum. SHE REFUSE TO Accept THE Blame FOR IT AND DON'T Refund THE 20$. (Well, you can disagree with the bank, you know? and guess what?!!шahah) I confess I'm not shocked because it's easy to find a lot of bad review about this place and its name, and how it manages a cheap sum like 20$ or 50$. It's supposed to be a luxurious building where you spend a thousand dollars a month, but they make a huge deal for a cheap number and over a tenant or maybe an interested tenant, just to be accurate, and you can have a unit in front of them, for all john st, or water st, in a modern building with A grade facilities cheaper than them. Building with a pool is cheaper as well!!! The building claims to be a ""rich, impressive Art Deco Tower"" overall, I'd say the building is good as well as cheap and ancient (and forget your delivery because all packages are not allowed to pass the hall). Facilities are small (just enough to say you have them, but nothing to brag about). I quickly found that the light in the hallway was out in front of the unit. I could scarcely see the number of the machine in front of me. The machine was in decent shape, but it was OLD with older appliances. You remember, like the theme of your grandma's dishwasher!

There is a leak from the neighbors upstairs because the landlord wouldn’t fix their bathroom tiles. If you look closely, the ceiling in the living room caves because of it & the dry wall has tiny holes from the leak. It may be a problem in about 5 years. Also, the floors are not insulated & you can hear neighbor’s tv from downstairs very well. 
There were a number of holes in the walls in the closets & mice coming out of it, but we filled those. We still had a tiny mouse fall from the ceiling once through the light fixtures; thank goodness we had a cat. Overall, the building is definitely crawling with pests: you can heal mice in the ceiling, roaches come from other apartments through smaller holes in the walls; i was honestly under impression that some were living inside the dishwasher door tbh. 
Also worth noting that the radiator in the master bedroom sounds like someone is banging on it with a metal rod at night. I had to turn it off for the winter. Luckily, there was enough heat from the living room (when there was heat in the first place). Also, the floors have clear water damage from a burst radiator in the living room & are very uneven. We had trouble installing our furniture.

Times were shifting and cash was being wasted by the out-dated apts at Parc place. Everything had to be accomplished in order to keep up with the demand. The property was sold by Connected to a corporation who found a way to carry the building to the modern market. Condo s. was their reply. This meant redesign in the building, including the pool, spa, lobby and roof, most of the apartments and all the hallways. Without some hassle, I can't believe anybody would think all this could be accomplished. I am going through it myself and it may not always be easy. I see it as an annoyance in the short run. The explanation is, after it's all over, I'm well aware of what the final product would look like. The house is now a condo and it will be one of the finest in Battery Park when it's done. The administration is very polite and courteous, recognizing the residence by name. During this time, they will continue to manage the building to the best of their ability.

1) modern/new building with good apt designs and layouts; all apartments have excellent natural light and terrific sound-proofing
2) great appliances and all apartments have dishwasher, washer, dryer
3) great rooftop views
4) Eddie (the doorman) feels like family. He’s helpful and friendly.

Cons:
1) The building needs to do better at cleaning common areas - especially the rooftop and amenities floor. It’s not horridly dirty but a daily or every other day cleaning would be helpful.
2) Most luxury building in NYC end up feeling like a community because the building has community events (e.g wine tasting, cocktail making classes, movie night, etc.) so neighbors can meet and get to know each other. Prior to the new building manager (when the building first opened) we had 2 gatherings that were well-attended. We haven’t had any in almost 2 years since. I don’t even know my neighbors. If they had monthly gatherings, we can all meet and get to know each other. It would be a better experience for all and increase building retention, safety etc. This is probably the number one thing I want them to the change. I’d even help them plan it if they need ideas.
3) the new building manager, Armen, has not really introduced himself to everyone and he is not helpful or friendly. It feels like he doesn’t care about anything.
4) the one design flaw that the building has is that the amenities floor is in the basement... most buildings have the amenities floor higher up where you can get great natural light. It’s not enticing to go in the basement. Also, since the business center isn’t a closed room any noise from the hallway or other rooms impact the “quiet room.”",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,5.00,5.67,A,96%,1

Construction has been going on for years and you hear noisy jack hammering every day, Saturdays included. It is wretched and never ceases. My request for writing this though is the complete inexpensiveness of the mgmt company. My apt for a long time with a lot of people in the building hasn't had gas for nearly 3 weeks due to a gas spill. It's going to take another couple of weeks. This effectively strips away any form of home cooking you can try to do and the mgmt corporation delivers about $200 without petrol for almost 3 weeks. This is a lie, and ordering in a hot meal saves my family a lot more. The best thing I'm trying to say is that the whole management is excessively nice and friendly.

With this house, the problem is Goldfarb mgmt. Second, the noise from the neighbors upstairs is continuous, you hear every movement upstairs or talk going on. I have mates and they say the same thing at the Bldg. The concern is the low quality of the structure of the house. Second, for weeks and weeks, tasks go unfinished. Construction employees leave nails after they are completed for the day, garbage in the apt. They are content with covering it with tile that does not fit if they have to cover half of the flooring. When a cabinet top needs to be removed, they leave unfinished wood behind. Leasing renewals - They keep raising the rent regardless of difficulties. Conditioning of climate - The temperature is and is set to be regulated by mgmt. Mgmt has been in trouble in the 3 years I have stayed here because they are not going to lower the set point so that your apt becomes unlivable and sticky, particularly in the summer at night. Maintenance - They purchase equipment of sub-quality which tends to split. I had a hole in their toilet and it was going to leak into the roof of my bathroom. The mgmt would repaint it about 4 - 5 times and for it to leak through in 1 - 2 days later. Finally, 6 months later, after I told them I was contacting the health board, Mgmt did something about it. The super's reply was to cut the water off as the pipe leading to my bathroom began leaking, ensuring I would not use my toilet until they repaired it, which may take days. Elevators - I was once trapped in an elevator for over an hour with 5 other occupants. Thank god everybody had a telephone. The fire department is NOT authorized to contact the doorman to get us out, so they just call the elevator company. Our 1 hour of being stranded would have been 2 1/2 if we did not contact the fire service. Around once, maybe twice a month, an elevator breaks down. The scale of the house and its location are very good, and what sold me and kept me living here is very good. The thing is with mgmt, it would certainly not break down too much if they paid for high quality equipment.

PROS:1. Managers do their duties 2. Modern, cool lounge 3. Shmancy fancy lobby (looks a bit like modern russian design because of all the red & gold). 4. Great little studio gym 5. Near to several different trains 6. Duane Reade 24 hours a day & Starbucks around Corner 7. Building clean 8. Each kitchen has nice chandeliers. 9. Breakfast in the 10th weekday lounge. Ask ANY neighbor if you need a 420 + dealer. 11. 11. washer & dryer in every apt (good enough for basics). 12. 12. Young environment (not a spot for girls, certainly, or anyone over 50 see nuisance below) CONS: 1. They increase the rent per year by an average of 7-14 percent, essentially non-negotiable, Strong Annual RENT INCreASE. During spring and summer, the upper end. 2. ELECTRICITY BILL HIGH The electricity bill is 30 percent higher than any other building in the city for whatever reason. You don't pay explicitly here for con-ed. This is bulk power. So, yes, you're still paying for the lighting in the lobby, gym, lounge and hallways. Plus, there is a secret fee right in there as well. 3.WINDOWS In Every Apt, the windows leak in cold and hot air. Again, expect your energy bill to be high. 4. At least 50 apts, if not more, are leased out to college students COLLEGE DORM FEELING (3-5 students per apt). The rest of them have bunkbeds. It's ridiculous, yeah, but half the house, if not more, is that way. MGMT is well aware of this. For a fee of $1000, wall dividers may be mounted in any unit. Tons of pupils, colleges hire out units and receive fees from the students directly. Models living in the building as well, mainly guys, no one near heavy, so don't get excited. They currently often remain in a studio in bunkbeds of 6-8 versions. Impoverished models:(( 5. The occupancy per apt is undoubtedly a housing infringement, 2-4 roomates in a studio, perhaps more in the larger apts, HIGH OCCUPANCY. 6. There are no FULL REGULAR OVENS that I know of in any appropriate oven, just microwave size ovens. Forget of more than one human cooking at a time. 7. Every floor has cigarettes, you will stink, the walls are very low, Smoking & 420. They should just open a shop here, Haha, like most of the city houses, drug dealers are in and out of this place. 8. Due to the elevated over-occupancy of the building, SLOW ELEVATORS elevators are very slow. The early hours, in fact. 9. The studio gym is very busy after 5pm. GYM CROWDED About 7 tred-mills for the 100 LOL college gals living here. Oh. 10. NO NIGHTLIFE, no nightlife in the city or any decent dinners. All right, 2 or 3 good old pubs, maybe. 11. 11. It's really expensive for EXPENSIVE Supermarkets groceries around the city, well, it's Manhattan. 2. ELECTRICITY BILL HIGH For whatever cause, the electricity bill is 30 percent greater than any other building in the area. You don't pay for a con-ed directly here. This is strength in bulk. So, yes, in the lobby, gym, lounge and hallways, you're always paying for the lights. And, there is even a hidden charge right there. 3.WINDOWS The windows leak cold and hot air in every Apt. Again, expect your bill for electricity to be huge. 4. COLLEGE DORM FEELING At least 50 apts, if not more, was rented out to college students (3-5 students per apt). There are bunkbeds for the rest of them. It's ridiculous, yes, but half the house is like that, if not more. Of this, MGMT is well conscious. Wall dividers can be included in either device for a cost of $1000. Tons of students, universities, recruit units and collect payments directly from the students. Models even live in the house, mostly guys, nowhere close big, so don't get excited. At present, they mostly stay in a studio in 6-8 models of bunkbeds.

The apartment is huge because it is costly and has a living room and dining room, as well as an eat-in kitchen. The apartment is a second-floor walk-up building with 5 floors and 4 apartments on each floor. The city is very quiet, given that Manhattan is properly situated. Our apartment is unusual because it does not have a wall between the living room and the dining room, making it a wide open space; the two rooms are isolated from any other apartment in the house. In January of the year I graduated college, I got lucky because I found the apt, so I was able to lock in a much cheaper rate than what they charge for the summer tenants, and that kept my rent much lower. Per year, mgmt just increased it by around $50, and I know that other building apts go for $200-300 more per month than ours since they were leased over the summer. In the off-months (November through March), you highly consider trying to get an apt—it might save you hundreds of dollars. The area is just below the University of Columbia, so you get the advantage of all the stores, diners and bars that want to be near a college campus while staying far enough away from college students that you never have to deal with them. It's still very much on the Upper West Side, but since they are still helpful for student tenants, it is cheaper than most UWS apts. The campus is about 20 minutes away, which is very fair.

They didn't warn me about the rental hike, instead they just sent a renewal notice specifying the new monthly rate and I had to turn to my contract to measure the difference-this isn't how most landlords notify tenants about the rent increase, they generally tell you that your rent is going up my $X/X per year, I almost did the auto renewal because I wasn't expecting an increase without warning 3. They charge you odd rates for your monthly bill, which is not obvious 4. They don't worry for you, they just want to suck as much money out of you as they can.

Well, very pretty, but beware! The maintenance workers want to assist, but they just don't know how these kinds of stuff can be fixed. In one of our pools, I get water up my ankles after we moved in and they just can't find out what to do (they did use a snake, etc). Heaters (you pay for heat) start every couple of minutes with a loud band—they can't solve that either. There's a mess up of hot water every two months and there's none for a few hours and no reason. No soundproofing is provided. You'll hear everything going on sideways and upstairs from your neighbours and, surprisingly, even below. Maybe you're lucky to have peaceful neighbors, or maybe not. Mgmt does not support and only provides you with canned answers and inaccurate results. I've never seen so many upper middle-class people utterly intoxicated in their 30s in all my years in NY. I have seen 2 men throw objects at each other in my hallway, From the southern building on 37th street (west side of 8th Ave), there is a used needle disposal box down the street that will give you a glimpse of the town. Even if you don't have children, you can't open windows larger than 2 inches. Mgmt told me it's the rule, but I checked with the Gov of New York City and there's no such law, it's just policy-building. The doorman is reluctant to ask anyone they don't meet so that they can sneak in with someone who is well dressed. Often, we have been advised that deliveries are often accompanied by someone from the house, but delivery people arrive alone. The lovely common rooms (you need to pay a charge to use them) are usually either too hot or too cold so that you never know whether you should use them and it can take a couple hours before you get heat or cooling if you call to get them to help. On very small corridors when they should have made the apts wider, a lot of space is lost. If you are 6'5, the wardrobe room is fine. Most things are out of reach for the rest of us and you need to have a ladder handy. The arrangement is to attract potential renters, not people who live in it.

The house has pros and cons. PROS: I love high roofs, a spacious location and a huge laundry room. Management is top notch-very friendly and cooperative, they make good attempts to keep us safe and never fail to remind us to pick up parcels and dry tidyings. This co-op building has very strict controls. You're not going to be able to bring stuff in/out of the building after the allowed hours (9-4 weekday only). And if you have guests sleeping overnight, be prepared to answer your questions. CONS: Co-op construction means lots of paperwork/extra fees/background checks. If you're facing Broadway, you'll hear metro trains every 5 minutes. The roar of busses/fire trucks/ambulances is part of life. So are the mosquitoes and the rodents and the low quality of the water, since the house is old. The walls between the apts are low. Often be prepared to see any nude elders wandering around-there are a few people who have trouble calling the building home and paying a minimum rent. The building is not going to be able to evict them. *** I'm getting out because the guy residing above me is experiencing a relapse in mental disease and likes to see water overflow to the concrete. Water started dripping down, and eventually the roof of my bathroom collapsed. Neither the mgmt building nor my landlord will do a thing about it.

The mgmt will do better, because they are the worst part of this whole property, to ditch Liza and the other girls there. The apartments are very nice and very well planned. I never hear from my neighbors, unless they're in the corridor. Electricity is around $100 a month for a single bedroom, which is cheaper than the last house I lived in.

The boss is good and all the porters and handymen are some of the good stuff I have seen. Both of the repair requests I put in were absolutely and correctly resolved within a couple of days.

Our apartment is unusual because it does not have a wall between the living room and the dining room, making it a wide open space; the two rooms are isolated from any other apartment in the house. I got fortunate because in January of the year I graduated college, I found the apt, so I was able to lock in a much cheaper rate than what they charge for the summer tenants, and that kept my rent much lower—mgmt only increased it by about $50 per year, and I know that other apts go for $200-300 more per month in the building than ours because they were rented over the summer.

During lease talks, do NOT give them a deposit. If you have the paper lease ready to sign in front of you, make sure you check for any Air Conditioner arrangement clause and don't listen to any BS on how you can overlook it. You can now, if you haven't run away yet. Electricity was included and we could use any A/C we needed at no extra cost, they said. On this article, I found a comment from someone who said they were not authorized to use any A/C except one offered by the building, and it still failed and the building was very slow to repair it. It's an old analysis, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and demanded it from the agent. He told him that it was absolute news, and that we could use anything we needed at no extra price, so we went on. I found a clause about having to sign a different A/C agreement about a week back, with the paper copy of the lease in front of me, and that you should not install an A/C without approval, It will cost extra and that. Outrageous, a full 180 from what was promised by the negotiator. The separate A/C agreement was not included in the kit, of course, either. I received an email from the mgmt firm when I asked them about it that said just forget it, BUT DON'T CROSS It OUT. The contract also states, of course, that written correspondence not contained in the lease is not binding, but that's no guarantee at all. We've gone away because it's beyond shady. If they weren't trying to do anything nasty, instead of citing a different Air Conditioner contract, they would only write the terms into the agreement. Now they are reaching out to me about how they made a special deal with the landlord (who, by the way, is on the list of public attorneys in New York City as one of New York City's worst landlords) to fully abolish this provision. Why doesn't everyone have this advantage? They play too stupid here, like something couldn't have come up before, it's disgusting.

It was slowly saping away my ability to live. It's no wonder the windows open no more than a slight crack. AptS: Of course, all of them have fabulous views. Given the area's density, though, you're just as likely to be staring at the windshield of someone else. The units make the most of the room, but the price is cramped. The finishes and fabrics are OK, which misled me into feeling that the standard of building was better than it really is. The gadgets are of low design. They use shoddy Haier brand equipment in less costly apartments. The refrigerators make a lot of noise, and my unit's dishwasher has never finished a run. Around two years' time, repairs never repaired the dishwasher. In the dirty ventilation system of the house, there is mold. I still feel exhausted and unwell while living there. Despite regular and thorough tidying, I had to tidy off a coating of grime from all of my furniture and possessions when I moved into my new home. Throughout the house, there are also smokers of cigarettes, pot, and I would presume other drugs, and mgmt does little except send out periodic emails warning people that it is against the laws. Thanks, boys. THE BUILDING: The covered driveway is the best feature. Birch Coffee is still perfectly fine downstairs. The amenities are otherwise flashy but inefficient for everyday use. They're undersized and have an uneasy, disjointed structure for a house of about 900 apts. Not long after I moved in and tacked on a hefty extra charge to use them, mgmt even pulled a switcheroo. Then the opening hours were cut and on weeknights they now end at 10 pm. There's bad cleaning. Carpets are stained in the hallways. The corridor lights on my floor were out for weeks at a time. The amenities are dirty if you use them. The pool tables are certainly never tidied, for instance, and have hair and dust trapped in them. The dry cleaner is horrible; They kill and take no responsibility for their clothing. See my other assessment. Management: Normally, the doormen are really good, but they are the only good people working there. I've been through the same journey as Anna A. And love to Lily. She is particularly inept and wretched to cope with those around her. Her laziness and weakness are also spectacular. I really, really dislike moving and had wanted to trade up to a bigger device without the toxic ventilation problems, ideally. I was able to grit my teeth and ignore the rest of the shortcomings of the house. She was finding it difficult. I pray you never see Lily. She's an imbecilic spawn of her own. When you walk out, as noted by the other reviewers, they will threaten to trick you on the security deposit. To have it back, I had to call repeatedly, which they did not do until long after the 60 days stated under their own lease terms.To add insult to injury, over $300 was taken out for the legendary floor repairs that the maintenance man had told me after moving out were not a concern. Location: The transportation is nice and the Financial District is handy. However, it doesn't really feel like a cohesive place. Crowds coming off the Brooklyn Bridge and ambling down to the Seaport or down to the WTC overrun the whole area. Park Row is also a busy tour bus depot. There's nothing against visitors, but these days, it looks like Times Square. In the city, one hotel after another has opened, so it's not really targeted for long-term residents. UNEXPECTED BONUS: The shockingly pretentious ""Luxury Attaché"" emails from the building finally became a beloved hate-read. What's the latest hot dinner the Times has written about? Where does Condé Nast Traveler think I'm going to be living this winter in Gstaad? I never tired of guessing whether this was for real, a commentary on my former neighbors' pretensions, or some kind of weird mental exercise.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,0.38,4.44,F,99%,4

Building management refused to offer us the 3 + months of free rent for a 12 month lease that new residents were being offered as it was not ""in their policy"" to offer discounts to current residents. With rent prices in NYC down 25% to 30% of pre-pandemic levels we felt we had no choice but to leave.

A warning to all potential residents;

- Instrata/ Greystar are a faceless/ emotionless corporation and are impossible to deal with/ appeal to. So while you may be offered attractive discounts when you sign up, do not expect anything when you renew your lease. They have proved time and time again to us and other residents that they are all too happy to see you leave and find someone else. Super disappointing when you have made somewhere your home.

- Construction on a 22 story residential building broke ground in January 2021 and will continue until April 2023. They start work at 7am every weekday and plan to work weekends. All apartments facing 3rd avenue will be woken up by very loud construction noises for at least the first 10 months of construction, possibly more. We work from home and I can attest that the noise continues all day and is very disruptive. If you do plan to move in, please keep this in mind.

- There are severe restrictions on the building amenities. The gym is only open a few days a week and only on ""even"" hours. The building sites nameless covid reasons for this restriction. The (amazing) roof cannot be accessed at certain times of the day and building management is quick to escort you and your guests off the roof and cite you with a ""lease violation"" for breaking their arbitrary rules.

In general I would warn all potential residents that this is anything but a luxury rental and I would strongly advise you to look elsewhere or negotiate hard before signing a lease.",,,,,,,1,,,Y,1 bedroom,,,,4.17,4.03,A,100%,7

From the elevators to the floor, they still tidy everything, and most of the doormen are pretty nice and friendly. Often, the guys in repairs are very handy.

The day before moving in, we are called to tell that we can't move in yet as they're supposed to be sealing the floors. They later call to say that we can move, and then cancel again the next day, aka, move in day. They say that we can move into a different apartment in the same building and move in the following week. What a mess.
Then after moving in, there's upwards of forty different things wrong. Doorhandles are installed incorrectly, the sink is linking, various outlets and lights arent working, and one of the bedrooms doesn't have power when it rains. For the amount of rent they are charging, this is absolutely unacceptable. It took weeks and weeks for maintenance to come in and fix the various requests, but I'm sure we will be charged for the awful construction jobs they did on moving out since they left multiple dents and scratches in the floor and walls.
Renters beware... Do not be swayed by the tall ceilings and slightly modern feel. Everything is cheaply constructed, and suffers from so much noise from the street facing bedrooms. The apartment comes barely furnished, we ended up spending so much on essentials like towel racks, toilet paper holders, curtain rods, and storage. There's only one laundry machine for eight units, and has broken down sometimes.

PD sucks over here, they are rude and not very helpful or professional from my experience. 
Landlord mistakingly accused us of not paying rent for several months more than one time this happened! Worst bookkkeeping/accounting which is done by the current landlord (son of frank-joe). 
J. C-Asshole, Landlord harassed me, made inappropriate sexual reference to my body and clothing and said something about being naked, screamed at me (in front of my son who is four years old and my son was crying hysterically trying to get away from landlord), towed away my illegal parked car that had a dead battery and a flat tire (parked there for less that 12 hours, roadside has just left).
He also sent a 30 days to vacate eviction letter with no warning or explanation of why and during COVID no evict period (rent always has been paid and on time). 
This happened a week after we just renewed lease for another year. No complaints and he renewed the lease and then all that happened!
Also cold unfriendly tenants in building. Have not made or met one nice kind friendly other renter in a years time here so far!! 
Apartment is nice and looks super nice at face value, but construction is cheap and put together like shit! Terrible cut costs work done, they don’t fix huge pot holes in parking lots either, I got a flat tire and my son twisted his ankle and got shoe stuck in hole!! Management Landlord company is a cement construction business as well!! 
Garage parking spot floods during rain. 
Garage side door always left ajar so anyone can walk into building. 
Horrible loud annoying neighbors with noisy obnoxious Kids who are notwatched by parents. Also lots of loud parties often and LOUD Spanish music played every weekend. 
ONCE HAD TO GO WITHOUT WATER IN ENTIRE APARTMENT FOR FOUR DAYS BECAUSE LANDLORD WAS IN HOSPITAL WHO I WAS TOLD TO CONTACT AND NO ONE ADVISED THAT HE HAD BEEN REPLACED BY HIS SON AND MAINTENANCE GUY ON PROPERTY NUMBER WAS NEVER GIVEN OUT TO US.  (no shower, washing hands, drinking water, etc.) 
landlord expects you to pay for anything that breaks such as front door lock! Um no. 
Maintenance guy is no good either, he made some obnoxious rude inappropriate comment to me as well, half the time he does not respond to anything also, gets drunk with other spa friends in parking lot of apartment and they act a fool.

My girlfriend and I were not sure what kind of building we wanted to live in when we started our hunt, but after doing some homework, we assembled a list of what we felt looked to be the best apts in the city and arranged to see all of them one Saturday. Ten Hanover Square was our first stop. Immediately, we were impressed by the huge, gorgeous lobby and the very good concierge manager at the front desk. We were immediately sent to the leasing office where we met Amy, who couldn't have been more supportive. She led us all over the house and answered all our questions. The moment we saw their studio/home office unit, we knew it was where we needed to live. The building already had a wonderful rooftop deck that we figured out was going to be upgraded over the winter to include barbecues. Big Incentive, please. We saw the lounges, too. Wow. Wow. Speak to me about icing on the cake. Two professional pool tables, a terrific sofa/furniture, a huge TV, and a complete kitchen. The larger of the two lounges is wide enough to hold more than 200 guests. Though we liked the apt, we were anxious to sign the first location we looked at. We wanted to visit a couple more sites in the city to make sure we were making the right decision. After visiting four other buildings in the Financial District, we went back to 10 Hanover Square a few hours later to sign our lease. And before our lease formally began, the second one we signed was regarded as a resident. Any question we had about going in the day, exact unit dimensions, etc. was answered happily. We've loved every second of living here since we moved in. Compared to many other NYC buildings that our friends and family live in, 10 Hanover Square is certainly delivering the best level of facilities at a very affordable cost! Obviously, there are going to be lots of people who are bitter about Hurricane Sandy and the house that has been helpless for two weeks. It is important to note, though, that everyone below 39th St lost control. It was a natural catastrophe, and there was simply nothing anyone could do to avert it. Relative to several other buildings in the city, 10 Hanover was up and running way ahead of most of them. 2 Gold, another very famous house, and one we've been looking at, hasn't been in existence for more than four months. Unfortunately, there will always be those who, no matter what they do for them, will never be happy. Everyday, Randi and her management would send a status update via email and Facebook to the whole house, notifying them of progress reports, when tenants should come and go, and always ready to answer any and all questions. We were amazed by how well the building interacted with it with such an unexpected case. The entire management worked around the clock, 24/7, all the while the building remained helpless. We didn't see the front desk deserted once. Not once did the management not do everything they could to protect the appearance of the house. And we never once asked why we moved to 10 Hanover Square. After Hurricane Sandy, as a welcome home, the building catered to Dinosaur's BBQ. It looked like everyone in the building woke up and there was space for everyone to be relaxed, to eat and to mingle with each other. They were both excited to be back in their houses. Apart from the house itself, the place will no longer be fine. Stone Street is just across Hanover Street for decent food, drinks and entertainment. The Financial District could not be any better for someone with a puppy. There are a number of dogs in the building, as well as a variety of parks within walking distance. The location is also conveniently situated next to nearly any subway you'd like to use – 2,3,4,5,N,R,J&Z are all within a 5-minute stroll.

We had so many problems with both moving in and moving out, for example: 
- we agreed on a move-in date, in writing, several weeks in advance; we asked whether there was any need to reserve an elevator or anything else we needed to know. Two days before the move they told us that the date was on a weekend and move-in is only allowed Monday-Friday (this was in the renters handbook but we didn’t receive it until the week of due to a holdup with our first rent check — they hadn’t specified where to send the check so we accidentally sent to the wrong place). After a stressful back and forth in which they claimed it was our fault and were overall extremely unhelpful and rude, we finally told them we’d be moving in that day or not at all, and they let us proceed with the move. we received several nasty follow-ups in which they made clear they had been observing us on the surveillance camera and charged us for damage supposedly committed by the movers, etc. 
 - Endless back and forth to get the moving company’s COI approved. The person who handles this for management seems to take pleasure in being as obtuse and unhelpful as possible, only dishing out information in small bits and holding up the process without simply stating what is unacceptable about the documents. We used two different movers (move in and move out), both established and recognized large companies, and each time added an enormous amount of stress and wasted time because of this. Just incredibly unhelpful and unnecessarily difficult to deal with.
 - It is a quiet building and we never observed any issues with anyone, but the Super seems to thrive on finding things to complain about. Overall we had the impression that we needed to constantly walk on eggshells in our own home. I’ve lived in many buildings in NYC and elsewhere and never had such an experience feeling like someone was breathing down our neck all the time, waiting for us to do something “wrong”. 

If you have other options, and there are many similar ones in the area, I would make your life easier and avoid this miserable management company. ",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,3.47,4.17,A,99%,1

Smokers live here as do prostitutes. Management also doesn't screen well so the people who lived in the apt before you may be escaped convicts from CA who are pedophiles. So be prepared to have the US Marshall's show up at 4am asking to search your apt for someone who no longer lives there.

Oh and don't get me started on noise from the street or leaks in the ceiling. When hurricane sandy struck and blew out a window, instead of putting in a new one, they put up a piece of ply wood... I had to live with that till I moved out all during winter.

To get out of my lease I had to take them to housing court and ruin my credit for 7 years. There are so many better options out there!!

That said, when you live in somewhere for a year or longer,  you should be happy and satisfied, especially when you are paying 3K a month. This is my first apartment in the City, so maybe I had too high expectations, but now that I have moved, I realized my expectation weren't high enough. Let me get past my frustrations, and just give everyone who is lucky enough to stumble on this before deciding to move here, the facts:

- You hear everything: I am not even talking about outside noise, which was not that bad, but between you and your neighbors. The walls between my neighbors could not of been up to code, but it didn't matter whether it was a soft conversation they were having, or they were yelling at each other. You hear everything. Additionally, you can easily hear your neighbors from down the hall that were having a normal conversation, due to the hallways all having hard surfaces, and the doors being made out of thin metal. If you want any sort of privacy, this is not the place for you.
- Disclaimer: It's a newer building, so a few years down the line, and this might be no issue, but there was construction still going on when we lived there. For a period of over a few months, there were individuals drilling into concrete above our apartment day after day, during the week.This made it impossible for me to conduct any productive meetings, as I could not hear myself speak and the entire apartment vibrated. When we reached out to the leasing company, multiple times, they never responded, so there's another disappointment. 
- The A/C and Heating units did not match up with the thermostats. Although this is not a major issue, it is just an example of poor construction. Basically, we had 3 rooms, 3 thermostats, and 3 A/C and Heating Units. When you turn one thermostat on and set the temp for the room, it would actually turn it on for another room. Once we learned the logic, it's fine and we move on, but it's a bit comical at the lack of attention this building has.
- One of the most frustrating parts of our apartment, was an issue with where we were located. We lived on the second floor, and below us was actually just open space with just the columns there to support the structure. Because of this, for one, there was barely any insulation, and you would need to run A/C or Heat full blast to keep the unit at the temp you wanted. Another issue this caused, was that there would be pools of water built up on the floor from condensation. I am not exaggerating this part, but when either myself or my fiancee would get up in the morning, we would step on the floor, and our feet would be wet. Where we had our dog sleep,  move her bed, there would be a puddle of water beneath it, and no, it wasn't piss. If this apartment is you best option, live on anything but the first or second floors.
- Lastly, and the piece that upsets me the most, is the security deposit. I am not upset that we had to pay it, but I am upset that when we moved out and they sent us the security deposit back, the check bounced....... What? It bounced? I called my bank, and they said its because the party did not have enough funds in their account to support the check. So we pay over 3K a month without missing any payments, and the minute the payment that we gave at the beginning of the month is supposed to come back to us, you cant fund it????  I think this speaks more to management company, than the actual apartment, but it should give some indication as to who you would be renting from and the state of their business.

These were just a few of the issues we had, and didn't include the problems with the fire alarm, stuck elevator, broken doors, cracked roof tiles, or the plethora of other issues I've experienced throughout the year there.  I want to give you sound advice, and suggest that there are plenty of better options for you to live, especially in today's climate. Please do yourself a favor and search elsewhere. Astoria is an amazing place, and we had some of our best times in this neighborhood, but there are better buildings to live than this ""Luxury Residences"".

The first 25 floors are serviced by 3 elevators, and another 3 for the upper floors.

My wife has not been able to sleep for the past 9 months because of stomping noise from upstairs, and mgmt has not even bothered to respond to any of our emails or calls.

The location is really nice - right next to a beautiful neighborhood park, and a nice walk to McCarren - but the street is very busy with traffic from semis, commuter busses (not MTA), and so on. Solid restaurants are really close, and many really great places are within a mile away. Good coffee shops and the small-ish Met Food are a 5 min walk.

Very unique, spacious loft space.
Live-in super is a huge positive as he has come to the rescue many times. Will also help out with construction / room design projects.
Neighbors (or sound proofing?) are excellent as we have almost never disturbed. Have had our own parties without issues.
Roof is great for hanging out with plenty of furniture for multiple groups to hang.
The block is very quiet and relatively clean despite being in the Lower East. Great food options on the block.

Cons:

This is a good spot if you like to linger in the most overpriced house imaginable. Images of staying in a ""luxury"" house and paying 4k rent a month and not being able to sleep in your own home properly. It notes that this building was constructed in 2015; to create this, they would have used inexpensive material and pipes. There has been an obnoxiously noisy, incessant pipe contraction sound emanating straight from behind our bedroom wall since the first day we moved in 3 months ago. Throughout the whole night and dawn, it causes a very loud ticking/banging sound that makes it difficult to sleep comfortably. You can still hear it even with the most powerful earplugs, and it has made us insane. In order to be able to sleep well, I am basically counting down the days to leave this house. I have NEVER had a situation like this anywhere, and it is outrageous that they took it so lightly and deliberately paid us that much in rent to hear about this. So, COVID hit, because of Avalon's structural and piping problems, there is financial instability, plus we can not sleep properly in our bedroom, and we want to move to another Avalon unit. Ok, Avalon let us do it for the expense and cost of an obscene transfer. They are not going to cancel any rates, they are not going to be aware of the condition. There is nothing they care about but their own bottom line. Not just that, but this house is not very luxurious. I saw luxurious buildings with a spa, a jacuzzi, and a hot tub. Everything you get here is a balcony on the rooftop where you have a good view of a huge crane and a large and Noisy construction scene. Oh and that's another thing, be prepared 6 days a week immediately adjacent to the building for noisy construction. Avalon cares only one thing under the smiles and just one thing: their bottom line and how much money they will make off you. Your well-being or what is rational does not matter to them.

We relocated into a house occupied by Manhattan Skyline in February. A rider that claimed that the building did not have a bed bug infestation in the previous year was included in the contract. We started having bites about 15-20 days after we moved in. On March 5th, we contacted the MGMT firm. On March 7th, they sent their pest control guy who did a visual exam and said we didn't have bed bugs and it was likely to be an allergy. We started to get bitten and felt that any other flying insects we found in the apt might be like it. We approached the mgmt business again and they offered to do a cure for the flying insects, but said they would have to use toxic chemicals. At that time, I was full term pregnant and we decided to get an organic procedure at our own cost. We keep having those bites. On March 25, the day I went to work, I woke up in the morning to find my right hand riddled in bites. We called another mgmt pest that evening and actually saw another company coming in with a puppy. The dog found one bed bug in the bedroom and I just gave birth at this stage, so we called the hospital's mgmt business and demanded care. They said the rehabilitation should not be undertaken for 3-4 days and did not appear to notice that the baby was just a day old and gave only a toxic alternative that would not have been acceptable for our newborn. We did our own counselling and started to get bites and then decided to leave the apt and move out. They have our deposit and, even if they find another tenant, refuse to refund it. We believe MGMT was lying to us about not getting bed bugs. We also recently found out that an infestation was also confirmed by another apt on the 2nd floor and that was on Feb 2nd.

Average middle of the ""luxury"" road rental in FiDi, with the worst mgmt you might ever imagine. The apt started all right. I had a studio terrace with a wide balcony and nice views. However, about two months after my lease, work began on the exterior. I've never been told that this building will take place before I signed my lease, or even in my first two months living there apart from a flyer left in my door about a week before it all began. Within a few weeks, my entire balcony was made completely inaccessible. A dark screen was thrown over the front of the building, and the scaffolding took over the whole thing. I would wake up at 8 a.m. to the construction workers right outside my window next to my bed. My blinds were still drawn, and essentially, I didn't have any natural light between that and the television. In addition to this unpleasantness, for a long period of time (at least months), only one of the four elevators was in service. The building had more than 20 floors. 1 Elevator, man. After dealing with all this for a number of months, I got a contract to renew my rent that was about $100 more a month. You've heard it correctly, they've packed out all of my open room without warning and paid me extra for it. The mgmt is shockingly mediocre, and certain people are grossly rude. The front desk guys are trying well, but they're just not up to the level of some of the other better houses. The area is all right. FiDi is a very unique part of New York City. It's amazing, but it's really different. It feels isolated from the rest of the city in several respects. I'm trying to say nice mass transport and dinners. But if you want FiDi expertise, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. I transferred out about a month early to another (far superior) place and kept paying the remainder of my contract to stop coping with mgmt, if that's any indicator of how unhappy I was there.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,3.11,4.44,B,100%,17

OgdenCAP (Milstein) are good administrators who tend to do the maintenance they need. The design of suites is strong and not vulnerable to neighborhood traffic, garbage chutes, elevators, etc. There is an appropriate gym (and pool) in the house, which is well-maintained.
 
 My main criticism about the building is that the administration is less-than-helpful relative to most full-service doorman systems, considering the feedback here. In a well-run house, if you get dropped off by a taxi on a rainy day, the management can usually grab an umbrella for you, help you unload packages/golf clubs etc. and take them to your apt, etc.
 
 At Biltmore, not so. Most of the management here appears happy to help rotate the circular door, sign for packages/washing, and announce guests. A few members of the management are unfriendly or even surly. This is because I think the average age of the tenants in the building is very young (often female, possibly under parental subsidy).
 
 To build on this point, most young renters don't have a lot of income, so my suspicion is that during the holidays they don't tip well. As a result, management does not feel inclined to be unnecessarily friendly. By liberally spreading tips to management that are useful, I am in the process of remedying this issue, but it is irritating that I have to do so.
 
 The garage maintenance (run by Icon Parking, not OgdenCAP), on a separate note, is excellent—friendly, timely, etc. This may have everything to do with the fact that when parking my car or getting it out, I still tip generously, but that's all right.

I have really enjoyed living at this address overall, I have lived here since 2017 and am definitely attached to the apartment. However, given the pandemic the fact that I now spend a majority of my time working from home I have decided to move so that I can live and work in a more positive atmosphere. 
•	Tell us how you liked living here
The apartment is a spacious two bedroom and everything in the apartment was brand new upon move in. The property manager and super have been incredibly communicative and amicable. They are contacted with an exterminator who does complimentary sprays each month which was necessary at times due to sightings of roaches.
•	Talk about the neighborhood and surroundings
Living here has been incredibly convenient. The apartment is walking distance to many shopping centers and necessities. There is usually parking available on the street. During alternate side parking times or when arriving home after a night out, it is possible to find parking off of West Farms road which is a fifteen minute walk at most.
•	Say what you liked best & least
What I both liked and disliked the about living here has been the neighbors. I love many of my neighbors, many people who live and work in the neighborhood are friendly and interested in contributing to the sense of community. However, at the same time I have recently witnessed many more instances of domestic violence recently especially since working from home. Similarly, living on the first floor I will occasionally awake to altercations and arguments occurring late into the night on the street. As an empath and educator, it is difficult for me to process the secondary trauma from witnessing the aforementioned events. That being said, I am choosing to move out of this neighborhood but hope through my career trajectory I can return to improve it.",,,X,,X,2,2,Y,N,N,2 bedroom,Currently live here,3-4 years,Front,4.22,3.72,A,90%,1

I have goodly enjoyed staying here and am sorry to leave. With high roofs, decorative arches and ample closets, my unit is well built out.

The water pressure is high and a sufficient supply of hot water is still available.

I have never had the elevators shut down and have never been tempted to use the stairs, unlike certain previous posts. The doorman, the super, and the porters are all very friendly and nice. They easily respond to maintenance requests and appear to do a decent job.

If you're looking for the peaceful leafy side of the West Village, then you can look at locations on Grove, Perry, Trade, Bank, Charles, or any of a variety of other avenues, but Christopher is for you if you're looking to be in the middle of it all. An earlier report claimed that they were robbed and thought that the building was dangerous. I notice that it's just the reverse. The police are still there, there are a variety of shops open late into the night, and I don't think I've ever come home to an empty street. I've found that the rent can be high and they've increased it in the past, but since I signed a new lease earlier this year, they actually lowered my rent. Among the occupants, there is a high vacancy rate that affects the community atmosphere of the house, but I have met some nice individuals and no one is rude. There are lots of dogs as well, but not many kids. Overall, if you're not much of a light sleeper, I would strongly recommend this house.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,3-4 years,,3.94,2.93,A,100%,10

In a 3 bed. We literally never had to wait to use the bathroom and it was amazing. It looks really modern, loads of exposed brick, and the two street facing bedrooms are super sunny! The water in the shower stays hot and the pressure is perfect. BUT. The walls are so thin we can hear full conversations our neighbors are having. We're on the 2nd floor and we can hear rats scratching inside our walls, trying to chew their way inside during the summer. One of the bedroom windows leaks every time it rains heavily. The oven just randomly stops working and needs to be pulled out, unplugged, and replugged to get it back on.

 The wifi doesn't reach all the rooms. The back bedroom doesn't have a window- but it does have a door with a window. But the window on the door doesn't open so if you want air you have to have a whole door open. And the room is too small to put a bed anywhere but directly against the door, so if anyone wants to go on the porch they have to climb over your bed. The closets are narrow but tall. All the ceilings and doors are super tall, actually. 

And management isn't really helpful, so if you have problems you're probably SOL. I got locked out once and the building manager, who lives a block away, told me that she lost all the keys to the building so she couldn't help me. I was dumb to get myself locked out but WHAT?!?!

Right by the 6th street entrance to east river park. Great local culture, small family owned markets and bodegas, offbeat bars, and quirky attractions. 

Pros:
Only 4 units, each is a whole floor (get to know your neighbors). 
Massive spaces, around 1k sqf each.
No unreasonable rent hikes.
Building is maintained nicely, never any big pest problems or malfunctions.
Units themselves are outfitted nicely, not the newest but very solid with good walls.
M14 D bus stops right outside the door. 

Cons:
A little far from the trains. 
No dishwashers, central AC, or washing machines in building or in units. 
Pet free.
No outdoor space besides ground floor unit’s private patio (not shared). 
No elevator, but only 4 floors. 
Avenue facing rooms will deal with noise, but not as bad as other avenues in the east village.

I'm a new citizen, 16 years old, and I've got one of the larger, sunnier apts. I love my apartment's interior design - high roofs, 2 window sills, fascinating architecture. This speaks to the artist inside of me. In my own dime, I have put several upgrades into the room because I needed a nice space. Because of that, the MGMT firm did not charge me further. There's some reality to a couple of the complaints I'm hearing, but they lack meaning. There has been a Thai diner at ground level for 24 years (now closing due to COVID), and perhaps because of that, in the lower units, there are rodent problems. For all buildings with diners in them, this is a normal circumstance. I'm on the upper floor and in 16 years I have barely encountered any rodent problems. There is a bi-monthly exterminator, and they're really successful. Even, the building is stable. It is possible that any crime reported was peculiar to the inhabitants I have never heard of anything like that being encountered by any resident. Some of the points I read here are true: doorman is very good; every few months the elevators seem to require maintenance; it is not a fancy building; best price for sq ft in the area; very well placed between schools and MTA; you sometimes have to wait a while for repairs, but if it is urgent, they get to it immediately; washer/dryers often have trouble, but if you call the number on the computer, they get to it immediately. Santiago is the super, not the landlord, for the record. He was there for decades, and he's not nearly as bad as people like to publish. I assume that all of the comments are made by persons who may have varying views of what their experience should be. That's fine if you have a budget for a luxurious house. There's no lack of choices. But this is a good spot if you have a budget and are able to put up with a more DIY atmosphere. It is clean, neat, and offers the basics.

The guys at the front desk are pretty good at getting to know others (and stopping non-residents). They have returned my security deposit in full without any complications (which is a breath of fresh air if you're familiar with how awful some mega corporations are). The room itself was not refurbished, but was still kept very well (as is the case for a luxury building) with a clear view of the wide windows of the living room and central air. Honestly, I have never tried to try out any of the gym facilities, but during the tour it seemed very good. Of course, the only drawback of this building is the site. I picked the upper east side more out of price as a young person just out of school graduation. Since getting to the LES (or even longer if you want to get to the LWS or Brooklyn) is a decent 25-30 minutes, it really makes it something of a challenge to get to the city's good nightlife.

I feel inspired to comment when I read the updates on my building. Second, yes, the house is old and needs to be severely updated. I have an older, refurbished apartment and the carpet in the hallway is very old. It is still tidy, despite this. The apts look different from the apts I've seen before. Second, sure, a lesson in English could be used by maintenance management, but the nation was based on immigrant backgrounds. They did so if I called for something to be fixed. Third, the office mgmt is a sticking spot, several of the reviews are now saying that I believe to an extent that they are arrogant and mean. The boss named Maria Cabrera was there, she was the hideous one, you could never walk in the office without tossing at you an attitude, that's if she'd recognized you at all. Since then, they've replaced her with a guy I haven't seen, so I can't comment on it. The assistant manager, Teena Mau, is still there, though, and that is the entity with whom I have always chosen to work. She was still friendly and supportive to us. She's been gone for a couple of months, and someone else was there, so maybe they're confusing her with them. I'm just grateful that they got rid of the other woman. Fourth, for the most part, doormen and porters are supportive. Samy and Ayman are the most powerful and often supportive doormen. Fifth, my lease extension was not what I expected, but I was offered a $225 discount after writing a letter asking that more be changed. Although I do cost a bit more than what new renters do, it's still $225 less than what I used to pay. The house has challenges in general, much as any other New York building.

I lived with her for a year. First of all, the floor was in bad shape when we moved into the apartment (they had recently completed it but it was peeling everywhere) and there were no plug covers in the kitchen. They eventually decided to refinish them after attempting to call the mgmt business several times about the board. This meant we couldn't really get comfortable for the first week of our stay there because we had to transfer all of our belongings into one of the bedrooms. We were advised that we would not be kept accountable for the floors in the bedroom because stepping barefoot on them would lead to unpeeling portions of the finish (fast forward to the last paragraph where we are now being charged for it). We also had a dispute with the energy bill, which was eventually fixed, but not until at least 20 phone calls to the unresponsive mgmt firm on our side. They're not going to make you go to the real boss (who's a selfish asshole because he's not fun to talk to anyway) and they always come up with reasons hoping you'll just give up finally. It's so annoying to have to call them every day for 2-3 weeks only to get an answer of some kind. Even, the super in the building is not helpful, we begged him to place covers on the sockets many times (he never did), that must be a safety threat! It took him MONTHS to get our hot water repaired on our sink because he was not able to come up and do it in a few minutes before the faucet began leaking (causing extra costs to them). Maybe it was that we were homeowners, so we were NOT respected. They docked our security deposit to the floor now that we have moved out (are you kidding me? To begin with, they did a bad job and they know this), And if nothing happened in the apt during the week, they fined us 1000 dollars for returning a pair of keys late, and they are docking us 1000 dollars due to wall damages from our pressurized wall that we had professionally removed. And now we are calling for a thorough bill of the costs accrued because they are avoiding our phone calls due to our apt and surprise surprise. I can't talk for building owners, but I would tell you as a renter to stay far away from this building, the mgmt and the super are just terrible.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,4.48,4.85,A,100%,1

We decided on Liberty Plaza after telling friends about the area and the mgmt business for advice. I can assure you, after living for a year here, that this is one of the worst so-called luxury buildings in Manhattan: 1. Winter Conditioning The housing is like a fridge. Maybe you're lying under a heavy duvet wearing thick thermal pyjamas, or you've got to power the entire night heating device. It's not operated by a thermostat when you power the heater, so your heating costs would be terrible. 2. Night Noise The garbage trucks pick up at 1am, 3am, and 5am occasionally. The delivery trucks begin to arrive at 6am for Financier and Koyzina, both beeping at high volume as they reverse into parking spaces. No matter whether you live on the 5th or 40th floor, the noise is amazing. We protested to mgmt, called 311 and also threatened to violate the contract. The only way is to sleep all night with earplugs. I've been living in many cities and in NY for ten years. None in this neighborhood is going to brace you for the environmental noise. If you've got little ones, God help you. 3. Daytime noise The buildings own realtors are very vigilant to ensure that on the hour they do not show empty apts. Why are you allowed to ask? Yeah, every hour from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day, the church next door rings bells every hour. Yeah, they aren't happy with the Sabbath alone. And it's not even actual bells, but a roof-mounted PA system that sounds these tones to the whole city. On weekends, when organ music is often transmitted on the same device, it is exceptionally bad. Don't bother to whine, this will not change anything. You're out of luck again whether you work non-US hours or have small children. 4. management Attitude Many of the management in the building are as professional as other building in the city. Some, however, have a very poor attitude towards carrying mail and facilitating the distribution of food into the house. I guess it's a lack of experience, maybe. But it's always difficult to get in if you come back to the building late at night, as residents do not have front door keys. You must rely on a doorman who is always on a break (asleep). Good luck if a mugger pursues you and presumes that you should achieve refuge in your own home. 5. Glenwood seeks to lift the rent by 3-5 percent each year. The question of the number of vacancies has already been posed by some of the executives. They also attempted to raise the rent again this year, when 2-3 free and also other benefits such as a discounted gross rent are provided by most other residential buildings. I posed these points and was clearly told about the rise in rent. I'm sure you can tell from 1-4 above that I wouldn't want to extend the contract, though. In fact, I assume that the problems with noise and temperature are due to HVAC systems that are directly open to the outside air, without any faults that restrict the flow of cold air or external noise. Although Glenwood typically provides a strong service, in their NY portfolio, this building must be by far the weakest. Seriously, do not sign a lease for Liberty Plaza until you are confident you can live with very high bills of heating (or sleeping in many layers) and sleeping every night (I truly mean every) with ear-plugs.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,4.21,3.06,B,100%,10

Social events are welcome and offer us the chance to get to know our neighbors better—and chow down on tasty treats. And I couldn't ask for an area that was better.

The goal is to explain, critically, what my partner and I witnessed from April 2019 to August 2020 during our recent lease period in Park Towers South. Remember that this was a unit that was recently renovated. We've been in New York City for more than 5 years, and this was the toughest experience we've had, by far. Here's a rundown of what we've experienced: May 2019 - dishwasher was inoperable and decided to order and install a replacement for over a week July 2019 - Living room floors buckled due to pipe condensation and former building debris left within the wall. 2 days of construction were needed to avoid further destruction, but floors remained ravaged and August to November 2019 would have required a bigger fix and major disruption - Regular building noise directly above us due to apt renovations (including on some weekends, which was expressly prohibited) August 2019 - apt entrance light removed and took about a month to repair September 2019 - 3 days of entry and 1 day of demolition in our bathroom due to issues with the renovations taking place in the above-us unit November 2019 - Kitchen sink plumbing issue due to r r Sink and dishwasher were inoperable for 2 days from November 2019 to August 2020 - Daily construction noise throughout the house, including normal, intolerable noise beginning at 9 am that stopped us from working or spending time in our unit (including the weeks of December 23 and 30, with the exception of Christmas Day only) — This escalated dramatically as the pandemic started with more and mo There was little consideration or desire to give relief to those tenants employed and quarantining from their apts mgmt would not be able to temporarily renew our contract without a rise in rent at the end of the term (note that this was the pandemic in April), which we committed to because of the shortage of other alternatives at the moment.I feel bad for current and prospective residents working from home and/or raising families in the building (two weeks later) which confirmed little beyond minor wear and tear, since the construction noise and the inability of mgmt to help make for an unlivable condition. A lack of consideration or respect for us as tenants after we have been bound by a lease agreement is the common thread here. The atmosphere could not have been further from a ""luxury building"" or ""luxury service."" We found that some recent tweets were made by a Park Towers representative reporting on them. In spite of what seems like a supportive tone in those remarks, I must mention that when we were tenants, we never thought that mgmt was equipped to support or mitigate our concerns.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,3.47,4.67,A,100%,11

He is very polite, professional, very nice, supportive and was always available to answer any questions we had (both on the phone and by email). He made sure we were ready and full with all our documentation so that in just 48 hours we could get the permits, sign our lease and get all the paperwork out of the way. We had to move a day earlier than the date negotiated on the contract due to unexpected circumstances and Brian met with the mgmt building and made sure we had no trouble getting the apt a day early.

As for the building, they have outstanding facilities to start with at a very low monthly/annual cost - doorman, lobby, several elevators in both the buildings, gym, pool, basketball court, balcony, bar, laundry room on each floor, etc. The building is beautifully run and the management of the front desk is just perfect! The apartments are clean and spacious with enormous windows that mean that lots of natural light gets in and have decent city/Hudson views. Initially, I was a little concerned about the distance to the closest subway (a decent 10-15 minute walk) as I commute to the center for work every day. However, due to the free shuttle buses the building provides, this has not been a challenge so far. During the peak hours, it works every 20 minutes and stops on every main avenue on 42nd Street. Just in front of the hotel, the M42 crosstown bus stops and is also a convenient way to commute. The free ferry buses operating on 42nd Street were also taken by me. So far, commuting has not been a concern. Right down the lane, there is a Sunac Market that is very convenient.

She still has a job to be honest, especially given the number of grievances aimed against her that have been recorded. This alone tells you that the entities who work with them do not care about leadership. They know that the complex location is in a high networth zip code, so they're more than cool with asking people to go f*ck themselves (without saying it directly) and we can at least jack up rates for the next asshole to come live here until you vacate. Andrew, sorry, but you're just a puppet and you're following in the unprofessional footsteps of your predecessor, probably soon. Actually, how you treated yourself, I had to LOL. Also, Gregory doesn't give a —— about you, so don't waste your time trying to get an answer or help from him to go up the ladder. They say that they are almost at maximum rental capacity in order not to deal with you on rates, but more units are available online than I have ever seen while staying at Gateway (not to mention the floor I was on had at least 25 percent of occupants leave during the pandemic). In mgmt, everybody plays the hands up ""there is nothing I can do"" card because ""we just do what we are told"" The only good thing I have to say about mgmt Gateway is that they are not listening to you very very very well. They will fail to get with you on a phone call and then they will have robotic email answers and/or simply not totally respond to you. So I always give high praise to them for that! As a business that tells you that they help renters out, given how high rent is and any amenity there is a la carte, it is pretty laughable. If you are looking for a building of ""luxury"" - this is not the place. Amenities would be used with every new construction in the area. All of this is extremely tragic to hear because the area is so lovely and everyone working there (outside mgmt) from the doorman to the maintenance crew is all awesome people!

Big, new, facilities are fine except that there's no gym (there's a private gym in the building that costs around $90 a month for residents). Costs are very large for the region and, as a result, you would expect a luxurious experience. Yeah, it's anything but that. For instance, I've never been told that we're going to be billed for water, pest control, and other fees that I've never heard of in all my years of living in NYC. Speaking of pest control, I've never seen so many rocks in the ""luxury"" building in my whole life. I can't count the number of times I opened or tried to open the compactor room door to throw out my trash, and it was so full of garbage that the door wouldn't budge. I've got pictures just in case anyone needs to see them. Apart from the fact that you're paying for stuff you've never heard about in a NYC rental (not a condo), the mgmt office never has any idea about what someone is concerned about and is very patronizing. For the opener, there's a legitimate crackhead for the lack of a better term on my board. Normally, it wouldn't annoy me, because no one's business is mine. It scares me, though, because she's crying all night and taking other junkies over like a spinning door. Not only does this keep all the neighbors up at night on my side of the 8th floor, but it's a safety problem at this stage. She leaves items she gets from other people in a laundry cart in the corridor. As many times as my neighbors and myself have protested, mgmt has done almost little. They told me that I should just call the police if it worries me too much. Ok, strong mgmt. Needless to mention, I can't wait to get up with my contract.

Heat is nonexistent under the current mgmt. Expect to pay high dollars during the winter months for your own heating. You will definitely find a cheaper luxury apartment somewhere in the town with the higher than normal rental cost of a Manhattan ""luxury"" apt. The doorman is more concerned about their personal phone calls, personal conversations with other members of the management or reading their article, leading to a major security problem. Eleven months a year, the doorman is disrespectful. Thanks to the pending holiday tips, December is an exception. Of the three elevators, at least one is normally out of commission. The typical waiting time for an elevator is around 5 - 7 minutes. Nothing is announced in advance by the current mgmt (change is building ownership, service concerns, etc.) and usually refuses to post a note until 24 hours before a change. I am confused by the optimistic comments written about Parc location, especially the comments that it is a fair building because your neighbours can be heard very easily. So be nice with your neighbours, since they hear what you do too:) Noise at Parc place is a major problem, particularly because many of the apts are ""Corporate apts"" and the tennants are short-term tennants (1 week - 3 months). Usually, these short-term tennants might care less for you or the construction and prefer to do whatever they please. Mgmt does not care or respond to grievances, so it appears to be very noisy and discourteous for corporate tennants. Garbage also appears to be deposited in the recycling bins rather than the waste drop and remains in the bins for up to 24 hours, resulting in very stinky hallways. There's a gym full of old appliances. That all of the longer-term tennants are really nice is one good thing.However, owing to difficulties with the current mgmt, lack of communications, lack of facilities, etc., many of these long time tennants have now moved. The building is expected to go co-op in July 2006, but the tennants have not been told of this yet. Pity on mgmt. The only reason I moved to the Parc location is because of the grants from the LMDC. With the loans, the rent was a decent deal in Battery Park City. But now that the grants have disappeared and the building is under new mgmt, I firmly recommend that you search elsewhere in Battery Park City before you decide the site of the Park.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,3-4 years,,3.82,9.40,B,99%,5

In reality, I'm happy to live on Friendly Avenue because it's a lot quieter than most of East Harlem, and we're close to the mall, making it super convenient to order. As far as the house is concerned, I have never had a challenge worth dealing with. I like my suit, it's neat, and I hardly have any problems. The few times that I wanted a fix, they took care of it. I wish the super would use a new mop, because it seems he's washing up sometimes in the morning, because it stinks bad. This is not every day, and the house is very clean for the most part. I love that the laundry room is on the roof and not in the cellar, and the machines fall down from time to time, so it's unusual that I have to wait a long time to do my laundry. I've loved living here, all in all, and my neighbors are all really friendly. Some persons have said that the building is very noisy. This is not at all my understanding. I may occasionally hear voices through the vents, but it is not a big deal and it just occurs from time to time. I think I have a decent overall experience with the rent that I pay relative to other buildings, and I would and would have suggested this building to my peers.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,4.92,4.69,A,90%,10

Wood floors many large expansive light-filled windows (for just one bedroom) granite counter tops nice small gym - usually with little or no individuals using it - all works (two treadmills, elliptical, stair stepper, stationary trainer, plenty of weight machines, dumbbells - all good brands such as Precore) toilet doesn't stop (but has other problems) good soundproofing between apts (never hear) Despite the good sound proofing on the walls, you can hear honking, motorcycles, development from the main streets across the house. Super distracting in the night, maybe because I'm apt. Broadway faces - other units can never hear the people living next to me quieter, except though you step out into the corridor and you can hear a blow dryer or music through the door - in that respect, the apt is sound proof. When flushed, the toilet makes a loud ""whoosh"" sound, which sounds a little like a shotgun. It never backs up on the plus side, but sadly it often disintegrates the paper and leaves objects swirling around - not a lovely sight and often takes many flushes to get a clean cup - unless you want confetti. The non-functional vent in the wall is coated in dark green mold that I can't reach, except on a step ladder, with no working vent in the bathroom. Shoddy construction - looks fine, but it soon becomes obvious that the cabinets are kind of inexpensive, A tiny pipe under the counter top loosened and sprayed yellowish water all over the bottom of the wood cabinet, irregular white splashes of paint on the underside of the cabinet and along the toilet. Easily patched with a screw twist - yet irritating that in the first instance it loosened. In short, it's a nice house, and the management I have met seems good. The room looks beautiful and has a lot of space that is light and decent. Yet you think they should do more and deliver above par for so many thousands a month - instead of purchasing very cheap cabinets, for instance.

 The house has no facilities at all, not a single one. If you sign a 2-year lease, be prepared for a 30 percent rental rise in the neighborhood since they think they have 'locked' you. I wouldn't put up with it because at the end of this month I'm leaving.
 I rented the penthouse, and I can assure you that because all the tenants are mostly college students or young, migrant United Nations workers, this building has no community atmosphere. Do not let the looks of the penthouse fool you if you are looking for a decent place to rent, and definitely do not pay as much as I did at 8,200 a month. If you don't worry for the 'no neighborhood"" no facilities' and just want to stay 2 years, get 2 months of free rent, 18 months or 1 year of escape clause, and don't pay more than 8,000 a month.

I still can't even stay in my business in my own lobby without being advised I have to quit.

I've heard that they have a reputation for not answering phone calls. But the super is very approachable, and every problem I've ever had is solved. I find my place to be peaceful, I almost never hear noise from other places, even if you can hear voices a bit too much when they're in the corridor. The open spaces have always been orderly. Although the initial architectural specifics of this building (built in 1989) are just average, repairs are ongoing. (They renovated the bathrooms in 2006 and are about to renovate the kitchens.) Three cons of this building: (1) given the lack of facilities (for example, no doorman) most of the places are overpriced—but so is everything else in Manhattan. (2) The house is under-managed. The super man and his partner are doing everything. They do a really good job, but two people are not enough to build a 16-story house. (3) The previous poster presumably relates to the fact that all of the locations are ""converted"" bedrooms. That's, most of the locations don't have walls devoted to bedrooms (walls that were built at the time the building was constructed). The landlord will take up a space (often a space that is too small, in my opinion, for a task) and put up a drywall to build a bedroom. The resulting leftover to the living area can be very thin. In addition, those walls have low sound damping qualities, and they look pretty cheap to boot. Another result of these ""converted"" bedrooms is the high density of students and new graduates, who are very accustomed to living nearby, and who need roommates to afford to live in Manhattan. Much of the time, this isn't a matter (in truth, for others, it may even be a plus), but sometimes, you'll have a couple of loud people coming home late. With freshly updated bathrooms and modern kitchens (and even redecorated hallways) on the horizon, the owner appears to be good at holding the property up. However, the initial building details and site layouts are just average. Be wary of converted places, if you're looking to get roommates. All in all, however, this is a perfectly fine place to live—a good building, a quiet block, but within walking distance of diners, restaurants, and nightlife.

The apartment itself was fine, with plenty of storage space, wide windows and modern fittings. The gym was ok and had a good range of amenities, the pool was generally peaceful, but the opening hours were reduced during the day. The block has a good roof terrace and other open areas, which were mostly quiet again. Adequate laundry facilities were provided. There are, however, several problems with 2 Gold, the first of which is the awful mgmt. After Sandy, they were completely terrible, had no corporate continuity and were unable to help with any adequate solution to the dilemma of making me homeless. The best they could do was to make another unit eligible at an elevated rent in one of their other buildings. In essence, they were attempting to make a profit out of the situation. The management was unhelpful, declined to help with any travel expenses, and left me alone. Any existing occupant who comes back as it reopens in March needs to get their head checked, as the mgmt has proven that they cannot cope with big problems as they emerge. The second problem is the building noise from the hotel building on Pearl Lane, which is continuing until the end of this year. This started the week I moved in, contradicting what the lease office had told me before I signed the lease, that nothing was being built in what was then a parking lot. The noise starts early in the morning, from Monday to Friday, and lasts until after sundown. A third, more trivial problem occurred with some of the other residents (or their guests) who were often unable to locate a trash can for their garbage and used to use the floor to dispose of it. It's not that hard to find one that I was glad to move out of 2 gold, and while the block has been positive, it's much more than negative.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,Currently Living,1-2 years,,2.22,4.44,C,100%,19

Nice location for work in the city center and near Tribeca/Battery Park City Drawbacks 1. NOISY, really. Fortunately, the Stereet building has momentarily ceased, but it was unbearable and will resume until financing is secured and the construction of the WTC will begin indefinitely. The street is filled with trash from nearby office buildings at night and all you hear is loud garbage trucks from 1:00am-3:00am. 2. Instead of reducing them in a poor economy, the rentals are pricey and the landlord increases rents. New renters can get a decent offer, but for current tenants, the landlord does not bargain. 3. SEveral exisitng told me tales of the landlord for bogus reasons withholding half of their deposits.4. The area is still mostly commercial and very touristy/crowded (WTC) 5. Because of its commercial status 6, tenants seem to be very temporary and impersonal.

I don't even know where to start-The property manager is inefficient and reacts as though she are reading from a script, lacks a serious EQ and ability to interact effectively and intentionally. It's almost as if the position of property manager doesn't exist! -Management is almost as horrible-almost as if it doesn't work. Front desk/doorman/maintenance crew is not constructive, you're almost wasting more time micro-managing them vs. getting things done. Most of the time they can't resolve the problem, and then wait months to get a resident manager's permission for outside expertise, which never arrives so that the procedure begins all over again as you follow up so they either forget what's going on or simply don't care about it! There's nothing to follow up with! Constant tickets are created for apt problems and closed without any solution-inducing the resurrection of the ticket! You have to track down the crew to clarify the situation in the long term, when there is no sense of urgency whatsoever! I've even heard the doorman lament about the cheapness of the mgmt business and the reality that they don't make much money—which is maybe why they're disengaged and checking out. -The house itself is falling apart-urgently it's due to an overhaul. The house is never clean on top of the peeling wallpaper, dirty carpets and broken elevators! Weeks are going on with litter in the hallways and un-vacuumed carpets. The smells are going to radiate from the trash shoots. In reality, the repair elevator is in the bank of the resident elevators so we are forced to smell/see that as we go up and down from our building-also very unsightly to the guests!! -They say they're pet friendly, but they're not. I see people have been fighting with the pets building all the time! -Doorman is a police resident waiting to meet up with them instead of HELP! Can you believe that! We pay a high rent to live in a luxurious building to maximize all that comes with it for comfort! Doorman is not supportive in the LEAST and is completely rude to the tenants. I don't need to be scolded or spoken to anyone because I'm a young citizen and a Girl! They have no respect at all. -Hot water was out for a week on a holiday with no advanced warning and/or guilt on their side. -They don't keep up with the upkeep of the elevator, so you're always trapped. -You will be fined if you lock yourself out of your apt-$50! They won't hold keys @ the front desk for tourists, etc.-They won't let visitors know or call ahead unless you clearly ask them to do something because it's in your notes! HOWEVER, when I actually added that the doorman never followed suit to my notes!! NOT OK as a young woman! - They've been setting up scaffolding for months and months, for MONTHS you could seriously have scaffolding on your balcony that you're paying extra for that prohibits you from using it under the 'construction rule' lease clause.

When working, I was at school and it was a nightmare. The neighbors were noisy, unfriendly doormen and badly packed with thugs in the neighborhood. Affordable? I paid a bit less at Breslin than I currently do at a luxurious building in Midtown. What am I really grateful for in this place? I am thankful for the following: secure, inexpensive housing. Far from safety. From the driveway, anybody can access the house. Homeless people live in abandoned houses. A heroin abuser was found wandering halfway nude several times. People come in and freely wander, unmonitored, from the rat-infested freight field. Good neighbors in the system. Some are prostitutes, drug traffickers, and undocumented immigrants who, though they dislike immigration, do not protest. With the uncivilized, the decent ones will not co-exist, so we pass. Security for 24 hours. The so-called safety consists of men sleeping on the job, slumping to the door with their backs and watching TV, leaving to chase beautiful residents and having tenants wait at the 'safety' booth. Some also may not understand English, meaning they can not communicate with firemen, policemen or people when there is an emergency. The 'Safety' booth is a place to hang out. Doorman to accept shipments. Loyal. They are good takers of packets. The basement laundry room. If it is possible to get to it. The 2 lifts to the laundry center are always broken. It is dirty as well. Remember the fact that the general public, without supervision, will come and go to Breslin. Do you just want to go without windows in a cellar with a camera that's broken and/or no one watches? With you, take your mobile! A manager who does his best for what he has, is a very good man who works very hard. The mgmt tells what you want to hear nicely so that you can shut up.

Before that, it had remained in only a few countries, traveling nearly every year. Finally, I felt like I had discovered a place I cherished so much that I had never dreamed of leaving. Last month, quick forward to me desperately going to work on the west coast, I had the most horrendous experience leaving the house. My whole living experience with the structure is utterly destroyed. I related to a building with many residents, even friends who wished to take over my apartment. Over 3 weeks early, I surrendered the apt to them while I managed to pay rent until the end of my contract. What I was meant to do, no problems there. Lucky for them, they got the opportunity to make a double rent. I had painted some walls after staying there for six years, and owing to my fast step, I had every hope of handling it from afar. They did that as soon as I was already on my flight, and they cost me over $1,000 instead of an alternative. For 2 painted walls, literally. Even though I was PAYING RENT Anyway, I was told I was ""too late"" An email even went to Barbara, the property manager, asking for the paint colors I wanted to purchase, which obviously shows my managing intent. The service elevator is still a garbage collection nightmare and was a tragedy trying to use for my movers. Flexibility Zero. I was unable to trash any discarded furniture on my day of moving out because they were using it AGAIN after my shift. To move a completely disassembled unwanted bed frame to the dump downstairs, hundreds of dollars more off my security deposit. No versatility either on the fee. I was advised that I should have dumped it in the hallway in order to escape my apt charges directly. They basically robbed my entire security deposit for nothing after 6 years and kept my apt in perfect shape (which they should be renovating now anyway, painting, etc for that period of time) and had little flexibility to my position or respected my long tenancy.

One headache after another has been induced by our' newly renovated' unit. There have been a few excusable breaches, but according to city regulations and building standards, the main problem has included proper supply of heat. Our heat broke in our 1BR unit FOUR times this season (including once when an electrical wire caught on fire). During winter storm Juno, one outage happened, forcing us to leave our bedroom due to dangerous conditions and there is still a small hole in the old heating and A/C unit that lets outside air in. And after filing a formal report with the Department of Housing Maintenance, the construction manager did not respond to any of our written attempts at contact. For the days we have been without heat, we have offered no rent adjustment; no apologies for the time off work to schedule numerous repair visits for a situation that appears to be fixed rather than properly addressed; and when we asked for breaking our contract to secure accommodation with more efficient heat, —— explained that the 3-month premium (so $13k+) would extend even considering our circumstances.

Cons: No big improvements are made to improve apts, no landscaping on the rooftop, and with the exception of a table with two seats, one of which is broken, there is no furniture up there, which is very unfortunate as the views are incredible. A section of a tiny gym and bike storage that is still too complete has no real facilities. The building was sold to Clipper Equity last year, resulting in the worst experience for tenants, it is impossible to get answers or details from them, and this year they have increased leases in many apts by almost 20 percent, which is just outrageous considering the lack of substantial improvements to upgrade the facilities or apts of the building.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,3-4 years,,5.00,9.40,A,96%,10

From what I saw, the same goes for Studios & 2BDR. But I would consider seeing more units as the rent is most likely to be the same. MGMT: Manocherian Brothers Sunstone Partners. If you don't need anything, landlords are okay, but the moment you discover a problem and need a solution, city building managers become typical. Upside down, the building doorman is pretty cool and good. NOISE + CONSTRUCTION: I live on the 16+ upper deck. The house is on a big road (8th Avenue), so the city noise is usually a factor irrespective of what floor you're not on for me. BUT, the building started work around May on the outside in early/mid 2015. And the noise was completely ridiculous. This will take until the end of 2016, mgmt noted! Furthermore, a modern building, where the old Roseland Ballroom used to be, is being constructed next door. This is what you would most certainly deal with. Demolition -http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2015/03/02/roseland ballrooms slow painful death for condos continues.php New construction - http://cetraruddy.com/project/242-west-53rd The foundation of the building has just began, so I can't believe that a luxurious 62-story building (420 units) will ever be finished. Now, I would consider having a device facing WEST, SOUTH, or NORTH if noise and visibility are not your primary concern (in that order). Not EAST certainly! A unit on a higher floor is also a concern, but not too far as work is already going on and the scaffolding on the higher units is a problem. - Certainly not paying a broker's commission. Units are OP. -You will compromise as well. Definitely do not take whatever deal you are looking at on Streeteasy, etc. - On almost any unit, Sunstone Associates/mgmt (Manocherian Brothers) has lowered costs. -Space laundry: in the basement. Not good computers or fairly expensive ones. - Upsides: convenient venue. Close to Columbus Circle/Central Park. Access to almost every route on the subway. Mathematically, take a look at the growth in the 888 8th Ave. (percent) of individuals who have moved out / vacancy rate in recent years. Specifications - 381 Units / 20 Floors 2012 - 47 Listings - (12 percent move-out rate) - 20 Oct-Jan listings (42 percent) 2013 - 29 Listings - (7 percent move-out rate) - 6 Oct-Jan listings (20 percent) 2014 - 105 Listings - (27 percent move-out rate) - 50 Oct-Jan listings (50 percent) 2015 - 225 Listings - (60 percent move-out rate) - 115 Oct-Jan listings (51 percent) * This year, 60% of the buildings have moved out!!",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,3-4 years,,4.29,4.67,A,99%,12

Only move on. And if you are a budding Goldman analyst wanting to get close to the bureau, this is not the place you want to live. There are no positive comments about the MGMT workplace, first of all. They are the most vile and far worse human beings than brokers. In any aspect, they would not be beneficial, whether it is moving-in, lock-out or moving-out (in fact that will be the best day of your life, similar to winning a lottery). The success of mgmt would make you run in the other direction. They also charge a heavy 3 month rent penalty in case you need to transfer or cancel your lease (most New York city apts charge 0.5-1.0 months). What they don't tell you, though, is that they are running a scam on your energy account. They use a crummy firm that gets 1/2 the time wrong, and the bill can reach $300/month during the warm / cold months.This is exceptional, the bill (with 2 roommates) was <$75 for other apts I have remained. These are the same roommates at Gateway that I had. The way you can think of this apartment is the expense of the sticker (make sure you get free rent from these bozos for the month) and then apply about $300/month for utilities.

She said there are 3 girls living in the apt but it turned out to be 3 boys. She said Netflix and Prime woukd be included and it wasn't. There is no mailbox service available for this unit, which she conveniently forgot to mention. The apartment is extremely dirty and has mice! The landlord was a nightmare. He cut off the internet during a pandemic because one of the other roommates hadn't paid his rent due to the loss of his job. When I asked them why I was being penalized, he said ask your roommates to pay the rent. How is that my responsibility? APT212 rents furnished apartment by individual rooms. We had to spend so much time trying to lodge a complaint against them but they kept cutting it off every month. They didnt even come in for the monthly cleaning despite me paying for it and when I contacted them the conversation just went around in circles with them making flase claims of having pictures that the apartment was cleaned. Also, the lease is signed with some Soho Lofts and not APT212. This also was not made clear to any of us before signing the lease and even after, as I got no answers when I questioned them about the realtionship between the two entities. They also cut off the heat when it was still pretty cold outside. Very shady and unprofessional dealings. And when one one of the roommates contacted the person who showed him the apartment, she ghosted him. Someone also came into the apartment to threaten the guy who didn't pay his rent.

Before Hudson Yards, construction was fine, but not loaded with building noise, blocked views, and a sketchy mgmt + leasing office. In addition to all being sketchy, the doorman and other tenants are the best. They're incredibly bad, they're not going to function, they're just going to send crappy emails instead. They're going to try to get you with fees everywhere they can. They didn't do their pre-move inspection in the moving process, came up to $4k with very bogus charges even though the place was pristine after 5 years. They were also attempting to execute an unsigned document for the transfer out. That's how low they can trick you last minute, even though over the years you pay a premium rent. Because of the development around it, the building is on a massive decline, as well as many new buildings coming out next door, so they are trying to scam people to make the most of it.

But * With the number of units (400), the laundry room is so limited and the machines are all taken down at night and on weekends, so you end up taking the laundry out. * Also, the gym is too limited for the number of units. They concentrated so much on the popular areas prettying up and went Unbelievably CHEAP on everything within your apt (from the bathroom and kitchen fixtures, floors, etc.). * Rats Oy. Rats Oy. * Rockrose is simply interested in selling rather than renting these apartments, so they are not at all receptive. * The tourist traffic may be high, but bear in mind that THEIR VISITS ARE THE CITY REVENUES' Main SOURCES!!!

This place sucks, because it's very dangerous. I never have recommended. 100 John is a somewhat false rental house. It may look shiny and upscale on the outside, and also in many of the freshly built apts, but it's a nightmare to live in. 1. Mgmt is terrible to work with the problems. Don't simply dismiss this. Mgmt doesn't care if the toilet is broken. Or because your boiler doesn't work. Or you've got to bring things in. Oh, right, the bath is muddy. They're so heartless. They're not going to let you carry stuff up the service elevator, despite the fact that no one else has booked it (you're going to have to sneak a short one with the reception, who's used to it). The apts look fine, but they're renovated, so it's all pretty vintage. The heaters are going to stop running. The pool is going to go down. The stream is going to be yellow for several days. The bathroom is about to get clogged. About all of us without loss have seen all these things here. This is a black smoky fire. The fire trucks were on their way. He starts filling water in my personal cup and throwing it at the oven. Really? They have safety issues. There have been 2-3 building fires in the 6 months that I have been here. No safety. 4. The roof, compared to other buildings in the area, is ----. it is tiny and you need to climb 4 flights of stairs to get there. Almost all the other luxury buildings in the area have far bigger roofs. And it is not high. No really good views like 2 Gold or 200 Water. 95 Wall has a basketball court. 5. The CONSTRUCTION NOISE. Apparently they don't do anything about this. Sometimes starting 8am, I hear drilling literally 3 feet from where I'm sleeping outside my building. I call mgmt. They obviously can't do anything about it. I literally have to flee to work so I can maintain my sanity. 6. There is no gym in the building. it is supposedly ""luxury"". 7. The ""library"" is a bunch of repeating classic books flipped so it is spine faces away from you. it is for decor. 8. The pool table has specific hours it can be used. it is not entirely flat. 9. The mail man has specific hours when you can pick up packages. (Just give it to the doorman who's there 24/7, right? wrong.) 10. The ""complimentary breakfast"" is a few bottles of coffee and like 20 bagels they bought from Dunkin Donuts that they serve at like 7am until it runs out at like 8am. They're laid out on a small table smaller than your coffee table. it is ----. God forbid you go to work at 9am like a normal human being, cause you're probably going to miss it. 11. Think it is cool that this is one of the few buildings that let you do a floor to roof partition wall? it is not. it is a scam. You are bound to consult ONE company who will charge you at least $1000 for the wall. it is a ripoff. The reasons I chose to live here is because it was newly renovated, had a balcony and was well-lit. The balcony is unusable in the winter and they don't allow barbecues. The renovation is a horrible cover up. You selfish losers, guy. 3. They're deliberately trying to conceal the major big flaws and problems in the building itself. 1. THEY LIE ABOUT THE FLOOR YOU'RE ON. The elevator reads L (lounge), 14, 15, 16, 17, 15. And you think you're right on the 16th floor because your apt number is 1604. NOPE. NOPE. Count the ground. In fact, the 16th floor is the 8th or 9th floor. It's just a huge lie to make you feel like you're living a lavish New York City skyscraper. You ain't. 2. The laundry room shuts at 10 p.m. and all of the units are split. Washer + Dryer is $7. What the fuck? Why don't you just leave it open all night? Why don't you just patch your units. 3. THEY DON'T FIRE EXTINGUISHERS ON Both FLOORS. I had a cooking fire one day, and the alarm went off. I'm not kidding you, the downstairs guys have come here. I begged them, ""just tell me where the extinguisher is"" ""we don't need it"" he says. It's a quiet, smoky burn. There were fire engines on their way. He begins to fill the water in my personal cup and dump it in the oven. Is it really? They've got compliance problems. In the 6 months I've been here, there have been 2-3 building fires. No protection at all. 4. The roof is——compared to other buildings in the city. It's small, and you need to climb 4 stairs to get there. Almost all other luxury buildings in the city have even larger roofs. And this isn't big. Not a very nice vision, like 2 Gold or 200 Water. 95 Wall's got a basketball court. 5. The NOISE Building. Obviously, they're not doing anything about it. Often beginning at 8 a.m., I hear practically three feet from where I sleep outside my house. I'm calling mgmt. Apparently, they can't do anything about it. I practically have to run to work in order to preserve my sanity. 6. There's no gym in the house. It's supposed to be ""luxury"" 7. The ""library"" is a bunch of rehearsals of classic books that have been turned until it's spine faces away from you. It's for the decor. 8. The pool table has specific hours that can be used. It's not exactly smooth. 9. The mailman has a set time when you should pick up the parcels. (Just send it to the doorman who's out there 24/7, right? Complimentary Breakfast is a couple bottles of chocolate, and like 20 bagels they purchased from Dunkin Donuts, they serve at 7 a.m. till around 8 a.m. They're on a little table that's bigger than the dining table. It's——-. God forbid you from getting to work at 9 a.m. like a regular human being, because you're definitely going to miss it. 11.-11. Think it's cool that this is one of the only buildings that let you do the floor to the roof partition wall? It's not that. This is a hoax. You are bound to consult a firm that can bill you at least $1000 for the wall. This is a ripoff. The reason I wanted to move here is that it was recently renovated, had a balcony and was well lit.

In addition, most of the apartments have heating and air conditioning systems that often break down and are too pricey for ownership to replace them. The building advertises restored apartments, but don't let you be fooled by the term.

Windows does not effectively block sound—Security is missing, typically without being questioned, someone can walk in from the street, particularly at night. — There are a lot of dogs in the house, but if you have a barking one life next door isn't good—It generally seems a bit overpriced in terms of facilities and size of apts for what you receive.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,1-2 years,,4.41,4.61,A,100%,10

The mgmt industry is arrogant, pointless, if its tenants are happy, it couldn't care less. That can be seen from the turnover. Low salaries that pay 500 for the same suit are the only renters that remain more than a couple of years. I wouldn't even complain about that number. 2. I'm paying 5k, and two of my three heaters are not running, 3. I had one lift serving over 30 floors for over a year with a total of 9 apts on each floor, no apologies. They once bought us bagels because of the trouble. 4. For 15 to 30 minutes at a time, he was trapped in the elevator three times. 5. My apt had been broken into, had stolen 800 usd. A few months later, the apartment next to mine was broken into, stolen jewels and cash. 6. Of airbnb tenants, they turn a blind eye, which could explain the burglaries 7. Standard facilities with a ""luxury"" structure below. No pool, no small, unremarkable outdoor space. 8. The management of the evening and night is fine. Fast to assist, quick to understand what they're doing, kind, polite, trustworthy. Management for Daytime? Since they are like ghosts, they typically work another shift somewhere at night. To save their lives, they can't multi-task! Now that I think about it, they still have a rough time completing a single job. 9. A very very nice dog. Out of all the New York city buildings they choose to move in one of the very few that have a pet friendly program, you have the odd loon in the elevator that doesn't like dogs yet. I'm sure they're not exclusive to this building, but you can find those people everywhere. Oh. 10. It's a very nice family. Take this as a positive or a bad one. I have no trouble with children who are well behaved, which seems to be the majority of this house. Typically, co-tenants are nice people, mind their business, support where they can, not loud (although on other floors I have heard horror stories about yappy dogs), considerate. To sum it all up, it's pricey, the mgmt has been doing this for a long time because they're covered by something on the contract you sign, they're not going to do the right thing so you're easily replaceable (for now) because there's no need to live here with all the other luxury apartment buildings.

A Garage: There's no garage here. It was changed to a daycare centre. 2. Complimentary Sunday Brunch: For 400 appropriate units, the ""brunch"" was two dozen stale Cosi bagels and old berries. Within 10 minutes per week, it was gone. It was then altogether discontinued. 3. Rooftop: For 7 years, the roof has been locked. Building licenses, which validate this, are available online. At any given point, you would never have access to the roof. 4. Laundry: It takes $4 to wash the equipment and $3.25 to dry a very small load. The laundry do not come out clean and in under two cycles, you will not be able to dry clothes. To wash a minimum amount of clothing, that's over $10 (clothes that again, are not tidy after the wash). 5. Free lounge wifi: There is a $50/month charge for amenities. It is not possible to mark anything for any of the programs as free. 6. Concierge 24 hours: There is a doorman 24 hours a day. The doorman should not search non-residents' Ides or challenge them to sign in. They do not open doors, assist with baggage, supply the packages, have some helpful detail, and make no attempt to learn the names of the tenants. They are not doormen, and definitely not concierges. 7. A Sauna: At all, this does not happen. 8. Gym: There are rusty and defective equipment and there's no AC. You should have secured a good gym pass somewhere for the $50/month you are expected to spend. 9. Stainless steel tools: My equipment is from 2000. Two decades ago, nearly. There is not even an ice maker in the refrigerator. The dishwasher is barely working and gas is leaked from the stove. Since they are so electricity poor, they even push up utility prices. (For a studio, service expenses are over $100 per month). Dry Tidying/Maid Service: You pay for these services. They are twice the expense of external facilities being used. Cabinetry of Maple: It's acrylic. It doesn't look like wood either. Wood floors: if you walk gently in anything but sneakers, it is plastic which gets scratched. 360 opinions: I'm on the first floor and for 10 months, there were construction workers literally in my windows every day. Mgmt wouldn't even have blinds, because I didn't have secrecy. For the work that started in 2011, they have failed to include an end date. Even, and from the top levels, all day and night the sounds from the West Side Highway are deafening and woman. Custom designed closets: This is crazy. They are simple closets with unusually sized shelves that make storing something difficult. Doors are stuck continuously. Moving Assistance: There is no such facility. Lounge at Club 90: There are a pair of tables, a TV and a pool table. There's a fee for renting the facilities to play pool, I'm sure. A wet bar and event room are marketed in the property. You are paying up to $1000 to use these facilities. Pets allowed: Exorbitant, non-refundable fees for pets are paid for the house. Centralized Air: The systems for air conditioning are old, noisy, and seldom operate. We went for various days without heat (we have also been without water on several occasions and have had brown water on several occasssions). The filter in the AC/heating unit has not changed once in 14 months. New capabilities: The windows are not sealed. It spills into your apartment as it rains and there is a persistent draft. Owing to defective plumbing, the sinks and shower drains are continuously clogged. Their reaction when you contact maintenance is that they know it and can't repair it. Everywhere, paint is peeling. The suit still looks dusty. The paints are all fake, cheesy wood that peels off, mirrors and tiles are chipped, shower water pressure is terrible, walls are thin on paper, lighting is awful, so despite having 3 high lamps in one room, the suit still feels dim. The apt house children from college who smoke in the hallways and whip up music at all hours. There, noisy house sounds are constant. There are still faulty elevators. To get to the club level or fitness room, you have to change elevators and take the stairs. The mgmt alone offers more than enough justification to remain far, far away from this system, leaving all that aside. No land manager exists. In my life, the assistant property manager is the most unprofessional, arrogant and underhanded person I have ever dealt with. She refuses to do her work or provide renters with any sort of assistance, she frauds tenants out of $150 annually in erroneous late payments when checks are ""lost"" she won't discuss or admit any fault by the building or mgmt, and she also tries not to respond to any emails.

The building itself is fine, the lobby sometimes reeks of BO or low-quality pot (it can be hard to tell), half of the tenants are easy-going college kids who are potentially too noisy yet polite, a quarter are younger professionals who are barely heard of, and then the other quarter are completely irritated tenants who moan at the drop of the hat and are probably accustomed to mommy and daddy's spoooo. Yeah, it's an odd combination. The solitude is utterly insufficient. I had the police call twice about domestic problems while we were having rough sex. In the occasional occasion my upstairs neighbor was lying down, I felt my roof was going to cave. The windows and the light to the street are fine, the street is tree lined, and the atrium (without a doorman) is a good sight. We put up a Christmas tree and do stuff like roses on a seasonal basis. Everyone Let's all in without any consideration to who lives there, because occasionally questionable people are waiting in the lobby. Management is good and has always been kind even in the hardest of times. They're opening your unit to leave shipments as though you're not asked, which is a felony. Mgmt is only useful if you complain about other tenants; otherwise, it is minimally helpful. The interior garden is lovely, but a year or two ago they started having grills and smoking outside. Now it's going to be very unused. The house looked a lot happier when I moved in.

The walls are small and the doors are conduits for unwanted noise, and they are metal beams. A word banished from the design language of this building is soundproofing. I can hear private conversations definitely coming from the nearby apts. The entrance doors are also not staggered. They are mostly separated by only a few feet directly across the hall. The architecture fault just amplifies unwanted sound propagation. If people just knew the things that I really knew about them. Doors, however, have no dampers. When shutting, if you do not keep your heavy-metal-hollow-door, it will bang shut violently, making a gunshot noise. The corridors feel like zones of conflict. In comparison, my door jiggles as other doors slam shut - as if someone is trying to gain entrance. Yeah, perfect for Halloween. The frequent movements encourage large gaps, which are continually fixed in vain, on the entranceway wall. The forty-two-story deep metal garbage chute is next to several units. It sounds like pins being knocked down in a bowling alley as garbage is dropped, and your head is in the pinsetter. However, it sounds like combustable explosives detonating as glass and metal cans are dumped. It's surreal here. Even, the chute doors are brass. When anyone opens the door, you can readily hear it no matter what floor. In expectation of a soon to be dropping rubbish missile, it is a cue to cover your ears, thundering 420 feet down a metal channel, gathering momentum for it to mushroom, and piercingly erupting behind a thin piece of sheet rock next to your bed. From the relentless bombardment of garbage bombshells, I developed PTSD. Tenants differ between considerate and obstinate. Popular hallway offenses include obtrusive debates, kids using the area as a sandbox, adults (metaphorically) airing their dirty laundry, and dogs using it as an off-leash park. One infamous resident revels outside my door at 3 a.m. in mindless mobile phone calls. Unfortunately, he also has a voice identical to James Earl Jones' doppelganger. If he ever asks me, NO, do not sell the Arizona condo. After his release from jail, your brother-in-law wants a spot. My 2 cents only. The building is technically smoke free, but for cigarettes and other illegal fixes, people use the stairwells. The smoke permeates the walls, so you would be bitterly incensed if you do not like sweet cannabis incense. It is also popular at night to smoke on the outdoor patio. We may not be able to see you, but we will definitely stink like hell. People have been known to use the loungers of the patio as lodging for overnight and, um, other items. For rowdy teenagers, improvised parties and the odd 2 a.m., the patio is also a popular late night hot spot. The brawl, which can be funny. Why doesn't Avalon Bay lock the sun deck after 11 p.m. One of the positive mysteries of creation. The units are cosmetically replete with standardized parquet flooring from Home Depot, the same orange shade as Donald Trump. Some units are ridiculously claustrophobic, which if you have started to condition yourself for burial, is good. In the kitchen cabinets, the acrylic veneers are yellowed, chipped and broken, so who wouldn't be after living here? Grouting the bathroom is cracking and mold is a fight I'm learning to conquer, Clorox, thank you very much. On a bright note, I almost have never seen ants, mice or bugs - other than the above mentioned tenants. The mgmt dress is uniformly convenient. In matters of billing, leasing, rental and Keurig coffee, they are effective. With regard to quality of life problems, they are less effective, because there is no incent$ve. Maintenance differs from decent to outstanding, especially when a toilet clogs or the dishwasher overflows (don't ask) in an emergency. The building hires unionized, competent and gregarious concierges. They also recruit $10 per hour in non-union jobs. Guardians of defense who. Well, they look smart in their uniforms. As for amenities, to access the gym, you have to pay $100 a month extra. Surprise! Surprise! You have to pay more for the sun as well! The rent is NOT included. A noisy electric heating and cooling feature à la Motel 6, circa 1990, is what's included. Hey, want a pet? For the luxury of making Fuzzy pose next to you, be willing to fork out $600. Currently, the laundry room costs $2.75 for washing & $2.75 for drying. Except whether somebody throws chlorine on your laundry for revenge, or opens your dryer to see whether it is empty and does not turn it back on until the door is locked, the devices run. Another good mystery is why the building opted for windowless dryers. Avalon Bay has the means to resolve the situation with a couple of points to remember. They do, after all, charge a leasing premium. In comparison, since its completion in 1998, the building has earned millions of dollars in the form of city and state cuts. Tenants are told of these reductions by a rider modified to renewal leases - so yes, they are genuine and they do exist. There are the finances, but ostensibly not the will. Interestingly, the building would have heat as an amenity included in the rental as one of the requirements for obtaining these reductions. The truth is, in both units, occupants pay separately for heat. They are forced to turn on an electric blower machine, which they pay for to receive some sort of heat on their Con Edison electric bill. It is not made available as required by law. Indeed, Midtown Manhattan is an enticing location for workaholic corporatists, seasonal foreign students, and wealthy theater geeks, representing the bulk of tenants from Avalon Bay. Unfortunately, the building uses its position to justify exorbitant costs while turning a blind eye to structural challenges at the same time.

You're welcomed as though you are a part of a family as soon as you enter the lobby and it feels very friendly and relaxed. The lobby is meticulously kept as well as spacious and well decorated, which is great to satisfy residents coming and going without a major ""people traffic jam"" that makes living here so much easier. The front desk is usually very supportive and there is always an involved security team. Consistent work on the part of the property manager, such as tenant satisfaction & complaints, as well as consistent email alerts and reminders for renovation, is thoughtful and beneficial. Management here is fantastic and the activities put together by the mgmt staff really make it a joy to be part of it and to look forward to it. The Resident Relations team is committed primarily to presenting and resident with events to attend, as well as a monthly schedule of activities. I love the driveway between the north and south buildings that stretches from 42nd to 41st and vice versa, which is ideal for drop offs and easy to walk to the highway or 42nd street on the west side. On-site pharmacy, coffee shop, and bakery as well as fast walking to the 34th and 11th port authority and metro train as well as the bus stops in the same area. I love that I'm walking distance in the hells kitchen from everything, but I really like that the building is located a little off the west, which is nice so it's not like you're walking outside and into a hectic setting. I love Hells Kitchen on that level because it's a neighbourhood and not a spot where it feels upscale or awkward. Regular Shuttle service is always going all the way to the east side in the morning at their allocated pickup and drop off hours and then they run the shuttle back from east to west after work to pick up people coming home from the end of their day and it is very easy and saves money as opposed to a taxi or train just walk out the door and get on the shuttle as long as your resident The construction team is on call and it is practically the same day or even at times, even the same hour or less, the processing time from calling for a fix to finally getting a management member address. I've never had any issues. The hallways are good and comfortable, as well as not loud, from every apt you might be in, as well as high roofs, and built in appliances, it just amazes me that when I'm alone, it's so quiet here and that's good when you want to enjoy your privacy. The park is great, massive pool, sun deck, gym as well as different courses to take part in from yoga to work outs. Decent facilities. For having fun, relaxing or throwing a party, the roof deck/lounge and BBQ are fine. During the summer season, the piers and Hudson river are 2 minutes away and nice to enjoy. This is friendly and relaxed, unlike other assets that seem to be uptight or too white a glove. I highly recommend you to take a tour of The Silver Towers if you are looking for a new residence, you won't regret it!",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,5+ years,,4.41,5.75,A,95%,17

There are many wonderful things about the structure: the venue, the cleanliness (mostly) of the open areas, the outdoor spaces. The doorman might be the best part. They are all great, polite and go after the tenants above and beyond (and they are why I award 4 Stars to management, considering the management team. If I were based on just the doorman, it would be 5 stars). The apts are pretty decent themselves: spacious and sleek, albeit overcostly. The floors are all absolute shit. They warp from moisture every summer and you have to spend several days pushing around furniture to have pieces of the floor replaced. On weekends, if you shower after 10am, you definitely won't have hot water. The stairwells stink like cigarettes (who smokes when there are TWO public terraces in a stairwell?!). The maintenance guys are fine, but they have managed to ruin my bed twice somehow by doing the floor repairs described above. Several people have children who, without supervision, let them run around the building and throw stuff off the terraces and into the ground. As nothing is ever said to these parents, they must be buddies with the mgmt. They're definitely the worst beings on earth, mgmt. They're unresponsive and it is full of sarcasm and attitude when you get a comment. They are very ignorant to secrecy (entering the apt without notice, allowing contractors to park their scaffolding in front of bedroom windows without giving residents any advance notice). Only all over the dreadful mgmt. I'm getting out soon, and the doorman is the one thing I'll miss. I wish I could take myself with them. The rest of the place, huh?

With views of Queensborough Bridge, Midtown and Downtown Manhattan (Empire State, Chrysler Building, United Nations, Freedom Tower), and Roosevelt Island, you are right next to the stunning Gantry State Park. The 7 train is easily accessible (10 minutes' walk from the building and the building also provides regular shuttle service from the building to the 7 train during peak hours, which avoids walking on rainy/cold/lazy days). Vernon-Jackson is the 7th train stop and it is basically 1 stop east of Grand Central and Bryant Park, Times Square, and Hudson-Yards with continuous service. With the East River Ferry, you also get convenient access. The building has strong mgmt, and is very open to support and help with an on-site office. In terms of pick/store/send mail, packages, delivery service, and dry-tidying, the management is very sensitive. With maintenance requests as well, the leadership is good. They have an online platform to send maintenance requests and to connect with other people to buy/sell goods in the TF Cornerstone neighborhood. You have access to a decent gym and a terrace on the rooftop. You have appliances made of stainless steel and a very modern/luxury feeling. The LIC neighborhood of ever-changing/increasing diners and bars is a very growing neighborhood. Best way to describe this place: if you are looking for a place with easy public transport access to it for a little more facilities, rooms, and quiet than most Manhattan offers, cultural/dining attractions are definitely rented here!!!!",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,5.00,6.69,A,92%,7

Here are my thoughts regarding the building's pros and cons: PROS: * Completely awesome management, especially the doorman. In my life, I've never seen anything like that—they are always friendly, they always know you by name, and they make you feel protected and secure. Too many names to mention all, but all were nice with Amadou, Glen, Vishal, Sunil, Ercan, Peter, Abraham, Bobby. I shall dearly miss them. * Good selection of tenants overall, typically families with children. * Nice spot, potentially the safest part of town, next to the subway. Simple cabs to search. * There are also apt views of gorgeous water. We'll miss our bedroom's expansive views of the Statue of Liberty. CONS: * Embarrassingly bad device for elevators. There were times when I waited 15-20 minutes before giving up 30 flights of stairs and walking. They're undertaking reconstruction, but they're not sure if it's really going to help, just not enough. I don't believe they're using all the elevators either, and occasionally you'll find that one of them is only out of service, even though it's not obvious why. * When you have a Milford unit, then skip all rent talks. Instead of bargaining with you for a couple of hundred bucks, they're happy to let the apt sit in the market for 2 months. It's the route for them or the highway. * Really, I mean really strict guidelines for furniture movement or shipping. There's nothing at the evenings, nothing until 5 PM. At some stage where you just need to bring something to your apt, it gets old, and you can't. A 2-3 year high-rise building recently began across the street—no sleep after 6 AM on the weekdays, if your apartment faces the highway on the West side. * No facilities, and this is not something I mention lightly. No lounge, no gym included (the gym costs $800/year/tenant, no month-to-month alternative, and it's closed during the day, which is definitely the most stupid thing I've ever seen in all of the 6 buildings I lived in in New York City. In short, it's pointless, you should just rule out the building gym. No rooftop, even though the building probably has one of Manhattan's best views. No open room (no varieties). After all that has been said and done, I suggest this building. We enjoyed our time here.

There's absolutely no keeping track about who comes in and out of the house that I don't particularly like. The doorman rarely makes eye contact with residents, only when listening to them.

Basically, 80% of millennials will be okay, except that people are not very friendly. Rides by elevator are quiet. At the building holiday party, it was a challenge to connect with anyone; most residents gave me the cold shoulder when I attempted to initiate a discussion. I've been told by friends and family that the house feels like staying in a hotel, but not in a positive way. For the most part, anonymous and cold is how I can describe it. 2. Fidi is so... Fidi is so. Yeah. Blah. Living on Wall Street, in particular. I wouldn't say it's dangerous, but I don't really hang out in Fidi alone in the middle of the night. TOURISTS are another component to remember before going to Wall Street. On the days, Wall Street is practically a crowd of visitors. Because of how busy it is, I feel uncomfortable going from my building to Broadway. 3. The expense. Put clearly, living in this house is rather pricey. A single bedroom is over $3K, and after I lived there for only one year, they decided to increase my rent by over 10 percent. There are a lot of facilities, of course, which is how they justify the costly rent. You do need to pay for the use of the balcony, speakeasy, and gym, though. Drinks cost about $10-$20 in the Speakeasy - there is no discount for residents. I just stayed here once in my year and would rather only go to one of the Stone Street bars instead.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,Currently Living,,,2.87,3.06,B,100%,11

The gym in the building is very small, and it's not well organized. The maintenance crew should have done a better job in this area. The other services appear to be in fine order and well tidied. Owing to development in the city, all tenants must walk to the back of the building in order to use the shuttle service provided by the building. The only thing is when the weather isn't good, going around the block isn't enjoyable or fun. Many of the outside benches are used by building workers who either eat or smoke. The units are spacious and have fine, easy-to-use appliances. The bathrooms are well fitted with adequate space and provide a lot of counter space as well as storage space. The combination of the shower/tub is done well, so you feel like you have enough space. The bedrooms have a decent place to fold and hang clothes. The units are done good, but you can't hear your neighbours. I will say that management is the best aspect of the house. Everyone from the leasing office, the porters, the porters, the cleaning staff are totally friendly and supportive people.

But considering the extremely high rents in this house, a better response would be anticipated than that shown by mgmt. They have an extermination facility on which, no matter how urgent the problem is, you have to wait. The operation is less than productive itself, and that puts it gracefully. Even, although this is not the fault of mgmt, construction noise, particularly at night, is normal in this area. Typically, it is either Con Ed or one of their subcontractors. Jack's hammering and backhoe noise is a fact of living down here, often loud enough to rattle walls. The management is good. The problems are not their responsibility here. Glenwood mgmt seems to be entirely disconnected and dismissive of resident requirements. Will it kill them to wash windows externally? For long-term renters, how about painting?

Without a problem, the worst doorman persisted, which just further voiced the indignation.

 . Absolutely random warm water!!!
 When you dance around and away from the sometimes-steady current of ""scalding-no-freezing-no-lukewarm-no-freezing-no-scalding"" spray, enjoy making fun new and fascinating shower choreography. Fun for the family at large
 Absolutely unreliable sun!!!
 Just to make it through the winter, imagine the excitement of buying extra blankets AND a space heater!
 
 Daily power outages for construction-wide!!!
 No occupant should ever have to settle for predictable electrical service boredom—Enjoy your status at the candle store as a regular shopper. BONUS: For the home-based finance bro looking for some variation (or a sponatneous break!) in the working day, enjoyment abounds particularly. Super Absent!!!
 Tenants benefit from a committed superintendent who retains a responsible approach at the slum level while trying not to regularly remain on the grounds or be visible to city inspectors.
 
 In the front hallway, mold!!!
 This building has got you secured for those who believe they don't have the time or patience to hold a houseplant. Residents enjoy a daily cure for their flora fetish by providing one (1) big leak every six (6) month span, as well as the mandatory ""plaster and paint only when the city is called"" operation. ""get-your-plant-on!""get-your-plant-on!
 
 . On the stairways, loose tiles!!!
 Living on the edge calls for full investment. By taking a friend along to guide you as you take your laundry down the stairs, demonstrate your contribution to the cause. Fun social time and outstanding training—for the lookout skills of your mate as well as for your own ability to roll through a slip! Faulty Buzzer front-door!!!
 A rare treat—It will take upwards of four (4) attempts to buzz-in if you are the sort that really likes to exasperate delivery people. Imagine their annoyance when they hear the buzzer, but don't really feel the door opening!
 
 Floors Unmarked!!!
 Thrill your visitors (or firemen, or ambulance workers) to the confused noises when they overload your floor because it is not numbered! Floors are denoted with a letter, apts with a number — a sixth-floor apt would denote ""1F"". Playing ""Guess-which-floor-we're-on"" is great!
 Dirty boards!!!
 It is a proven reality that when it is not mirrored in a too-shiny floor, peeling paint in hallways is much less irritating. Trash Field Bursting!!!
 In the common room, recycling is blissfully overlooked — residents appreciate bad labels and vague delineations for recycling all forms of items. Trashcans are frequently left to spill over—In this house, we take pride in our refuse and we want to display it on the ground!

First, some of the drawbacks: yeah, rentals can get pretty expensive, but that's what you're paying for a Manhattan doorman's building just a mile from the subway. There are also occasions that street noise can get pretty noisy as work progresses on the 2nd Ave. subway (even in my 26th floor apt). Finally, there is a very nice on-site laundry room, but I still seem to have a problem with the machines that take your cash for a cash card. Now, some of the pros: the moniker of ""Dorm-andie"" that many have attributed to the building is absolutely real. Over the house, I have made a nice group of friends, and it is fun to be able to do stuff locally with them. Security was never a challenge for me. The UES is a very safe place, and you don't have to think about unwelcome visitors, because the building has a doorman. The upstairs gym is a good one (but not good gym). Second, there is a separate charge (about $700 per month) to get this out of the way. That, however, is so worth it. I'm not going to say that it's at the NYSC standard, but it's got a whole free weight room, a lot of weight machines, and a decent range of exercise machines. There is also a studio where FREE lessons are held everyday (for members). These courses include cardio classes and yoga style ""boot camp"". When you take plenty of them, these courses are worth the membership fee on their own. The downside is that they're not really tidying the gym that much, because if it fails, it takes them forever to repair a computer. Other house notes: there are two cats for my wife and me, and the building is completely cool. Many people have pets, and I don't think there's a limit on size. The lifts have a bad propensity to go out very frequently and it can take a while for them to patch them. It's an irritation, so it's not a deal-breaker. Beneath the house is a parking garage. It's pricey (just over $400/month), but without setting foot outside, you can get to your home.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,1-2 years ago,5+ years,,4.14,4.70,A,99%,16

Nearest subway is a walk (3 aves over), but on the flipside it's nice to be only a block from the river, greenway, and a really nice pier (84).

If you use a personal bike the building's system is pretty annoying.  You *have* to store your bike with the bike store on the first floor, which is free, but requires you to have to call down and have the staff get it out for you any time you want to ride it.  If you need it outside of their operating hours you have to remember to call the day before so it can be left in a small storage area the doorman can buzz you into.  If you forget, or if it's a holiday they close for you're pretty much out of luck.  As such I've switched to using Citibike pretty much 100% for getting around town.  There's a few nearby stations, but weekdays can be issues in the morning and especially at night after ~9pm, where a few times the closest station with an open dock has been 3 aves over on 8th.",X,,,,,4,3,N,N,N,Studio,Currently live here,1-2 years,Westside,4.86,5.75,A,98%,8

These buildings are right behind the projects and my neighbors, and I would hear gunfire and police or ambulances on the street would still be there. The elevator and washing machines were continually falling down, the water was switched off without warning several times, and there were difficulties in the afternoons with either no or very little hot water. In the office, Robert Piven is unprofessional, arrogant, and if you have a problem, sometimes he won't respond. When it comes to security deposits and rental renewals, he and the mgmt building were very shady. I personally met and listened to a handful of people who, at the time I lived there, were both recent and existing residents who had legal disputes with the mgmt building in terms of leases, security deposits, proper lease renewal notice, etc. The halls were still dusty.Often litter or debris would linger for several weeks on the corridor surfaces, and cockroaches in the halls or the apt units were also common to see. The only positive thing about this house, basically, is the location, but in the area where the building is not run as a slum, there are so many other options. I know someone who actually lives in one of the buildings who said nothing has changed and that as soon as their lease is over, they plan to move out. I wouldn't bother staying in any of the buildings that are part of the 62 West LLC community on 64th or 63rd between 10th & 11th.

It's the 213 W. 22nd St property is operated by a man named——————————, who is, sadly, very challenging and has a severe attitude problem. Given the expensive monthly rent, you'd imagine he'd be a bit more open to simple demands. Yet, unfortunately, most of the inquiries were met with difficulty and absolute disrespect. In more than one instance, the property manager———————-hung the phone on me because he had taken an approach to the request. It was like living with a grown-up kid. ———————-The bulk of demands will not be disturbed, and therefore would choose to receive a discount through regular leasing fees. In my view, he considers himself above the responsibilities of the property manager, and this pessimistic mentality is visible in his attitude and regard towards tenants. He also worked as a property broker, meaning that he paid a decent broker rate when I first signed the contract. Few issues: when we had a significant rat epidemic, it took weeks back and forth before the problem was fixed. Turns out that they were living in the roof above the laundry room and had been defecating there for months. The scent was so insufferable and poisonous. After several trips by the exterminators,————————-Finally decided to replace the drywall throughout the laundry room soaked in rodent feces. In the contract, the last thing specifies that you are responsible for removing any ice or snow during the season. If you don't, the house is going to get all right by NYC and———————it demands that you pay all right. Normally, this would be the role of the property manager, but it's clear that he threw this clause into it so that he wouldn't have to do real work to handle the property. Warning: the power bill in this place would cost you between $500 and $1,000 a month, provided the high roofs, old equipment (not energy-friendly) and built-in, non-insulated windows. There is a system to heat the front sidewalk during the winter so you don't have to shovel the snow, but this will push the power bill to an astronomical amount. On my move-out day, the builders came to the house when I was already making several trips back and forth to my new residence. On one visit, they threw away everything that I had not yet moved into the kitchen (hundreds of dollars worth of spices and cooking oils that were still in the cabinet or neatly stacked on the counter)—even though I said—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— As I suggested this to—————-, he said that my own movers had to snatch everything. -It is my assumption that he embellished the expense of pocketing any spare cash believing that my only option would be to take him to court.

Since October 09, they have been here. Nice layout. A lot of rooms for closets. My hubby and I don't feel crowded at all, even though it's just a studio for Junior One. 7 wardrobes! A foyer and a short passage to the toilet! It's not quite 600 square feet, which is incredible. In our house, the very silent Washer Dryer. However, our stove is not silent, LOL Something rattles when we use it, but we hardly ever use it, so we didn't ask a repair guy to fix it. As for traffic: no noise from neighbours outside the walls. Oh, nothing. People in the corridor, however, can be heard while they're talking (but that's not a big problem). We are, though, so fortunate to have neighbors with one especially noisy, bratty Annoying kid at the end of the hall who cries every single day of our lives in the hallway for a couple of minutes every morning and every evening. I don't know what kind of harm the little girl is doing, so I hate her. As for the noise from outside the curtains, we are faced West on the 28th floor, overlooking 96th street. This is a busy, Very noisy junction. I'm nearly brought to tears by blasted police and ambulance and fire truck sirens, but my husband insists I'm only being over-sensitive and emotional. He may be right. Anyway, there's still a traffic bottle neck below that often adds to taxi drivers' Repetitive and Violent horn honking. They'll lie right on the horn for 15 seconds. I switch on the heat or AC machine if it becomes too much and the sound is then completely blocked out. There's also a mosque right below, and you can hear their call to prayers on Friday afternoon that I don't mind and think is pretty (at least it's way better than sirens, bells, and a wailing kid!) The exercise room is good. There's a nice tub. Sun Terrace is gorgeous. Elevators are fast and still operational. Awesome subway and Central Park venue. The sum of wind when you come to the corner of 3rd and 96th is one pull back. Whew. Whew. You'll be frozen to the bone walking home from work. There's a really good squad of doormen. A few of them grin more than the rest, but in their work, they are all really sweet. Location: it's the upper east side, just scarcely so! There are lots of restaurants to stroll to, but it is not the hippest part. Sort of dull, in fact. Yet ""coolness"" is within walking distance and you can get on 6, which is a 3-minute stroll. Yeah, this building is ALL For KIDS, by the way. We don't have any of our own and really tend to feed them (BBQ'd), but this is NOT the building for you if you don't have kids and don't want to be around them! Don't worry — when parents don't look, we haven't pinched either of them, we have behaved ourselves. Sometimes, my hubby and I take a long stroll through Central Park for dinner on the west side. It's a very lovely one if you like long walks. This house, I do suggest it. You'll be relieved, I guess. If there is a concern with noise: Don't get an apt facing 96th or 3rd. Get one facing the 97th, if necessary.

The administration is good, they usually respond to emails and calls right away to fix anything you need. The bad part is that people usually hang out outside the door blocking the entrance. The apartments are affordable, good, but they have thin walls and you can hear everything either from people outside your apartment or even your  floor neighbours.

A station less than a minute's walk from the complex offers easy access to the NQRW, BDFM & PATH lines. It's all a 5-minute walk to Penn Station and other subway lines. Koreatown, the Empire State House, Madison Square Garden, and more are highlights of the surrounding area. At Herald Castles, the rooms themselves are on the smaller side. My roommates and I live in an apartment that was originally a 1 BR apartment that had the living room converted into two extra apartments. The master bedroom is roomy, but on the smaller side are the two other rooms. The apartments have very high roofs in this house, so there is plenty of vertical space to be used for storage and shelving. There are several facilities in the complex itself. The facility is on the older side, but a modern gym that has a wide variety of equipment has recently been upgraded. On the 3rd floor, in-building laundry is open. There is a resident lounge that can be reserved for activities and a rooftop lounge. As part of the rent, heat and air conditioning are included. At the security desk, there is a doorman and the building feels very safe. The one problem I have is that Super is usually unresponsive via email. Maintenance requests made through the building portal are answered promptly, but a visit to the leasing office inside the building is almost mandatory to connect with super, which is typically only available during regular business hours.",,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,4.19,4.19,A,99%,23
